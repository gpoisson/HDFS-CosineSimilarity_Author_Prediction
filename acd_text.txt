Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Hungerton, her father, really was the most tactless person upon  earth,--a fluffy, feathery, untidy cockatoo of a man, perfectly  good-natured, but absolutely centered upon his own silly self.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If  anything could have driven me from Gladys, it would have been the  thought of such a father-in-law.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am convinced that he really  believed in his heart that I came round to the Chestnuts three days a  week for the pleasure of his company, and very especially to hear his  views upon bimetallism, a subject upon which he was by way of being an  authority.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For an hour or more that evening I listened to his monotonous chirrup  about bad money driving out good, the token value of silver, the  depreciation of the rupee, and the true standards of exchange.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Suppose," he cried with feeble violence, "that all the debts in the  world were called up simultaneously, and immediate payment insisted  upon,--what under our present conditions would happen then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I gave the self-evident answer that I should be a ruined man, upon  which he jumped from his chair, reproved me for my habitual levity,  which made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in  my presence, and bounced off out of the room to dress for a Masonic  meeting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last I was alone with Gladys, and the moment of Fate had come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All  that evening I had felt like the soldier who awaits the signal which  will send him on a forlorn hope; hope of victory and fear of repulse  alternating in his mind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>She sat with that proud, delicate profile of hers outlined against the  red curtain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How beautiful she was.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet how aloof.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had been  friends, quite good friends; but never could I get beyond the same  comradeship which I might have established with one of my  fellow-reporters upon the Gazette,--perfectly frank, perfectly kindly,  and perfectly unsexual.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My instincts are all against a woman being too  frank and at her ease with me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is no compliment to a man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Where  the real sex feeling begins, timidity and distrust are its companions,  heritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in  hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The bent head, the averted eye, the faltering voice, the wincing  figure--these, and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply, are the  true signals of passion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even in my short life I had learned as much  as that--or had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Gladys was full of every womanly quality.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some judged her to be cold  and hard; but such a thought was treason.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That delicately bronzed  skin, almost oriental in its coloring, that raven hair, the large  liquid eyes, the full but exquisite lips,--all the stigmata of passion  were there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I was sadly conscious that up to now I had never found  the secret of drawing it forth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>However, come what might, I should  have done with suspense and bring matters to a head to-night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>She  could but refuse me, and better be a repulsed lover than an accepted  brother.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So far my thoughts had carried me, and I was about to break the long  and uneasy silence, when two critical, dark eyes looked round at me,  and the proud head was shaken in smiling reproof.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I have a  presentiment that you are going to propose, Ned.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I do wish you  wouldn't; for things are so much nicer as they are.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I drew my chair a little nearer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Now, how did you know that I was  going to propose.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked in genuine wonder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Don't women always know.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Do you suppose any woman in the world was  ever taken unawares.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But--oh, Ned, our friendship has been so good and  so pleasant.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What a pity to spoil it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't you feel how splendid it  is that a young man and a young woman should be able to talk face to  face as we have talked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I don't know, Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You see, I can talk face to face with--with the  station-master.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  I can't imagine how that official came into the  matter; but in he trotted, and set us both laughing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"That does not  satisfy me in the least.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I want my arms round you, and your head on my  breast, and--oh, Gladys, I want----"    She had sprung from her chair, as she saw signs that I proposed to  demonstrate some of my wants.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You've spoiled everything, Ned," she  said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's all so beautiful and natural until this kind of thing  comes in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is such a pity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why can't you control yourself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I didn't invent it," I pleaded.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's nature.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's love.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, perhaps if both love, it may be different.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have never felt  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But you must--you, with your beauty, with your soul.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Oh, Gladys, you  were made for love.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You must love.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "One must wait till it comes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But why can't you love me, Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Is it my appearance, or what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    She did unbend a little.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>She put forward a hand--such a gracious,  stooping attitude it was--and she pressed back my head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then she  looked into my upturned face with a very wistful smile.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No it isn't that," she said at last.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You're not a conceited boy by  nature, and so I can safely tell you it is not that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's deeper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "My character.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    She nodded severely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What can I do to mend it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Do sit down and talk it over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No, really,  I won't if you'll only sit down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    She looked at me with a wondering distrust which was much more to my  mind than her whole-hearted confidence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How primitive and bestial it  looks when you put it down in black and white.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>--and perhaps after all  it is only a feeling peculiar to myself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Anyhow, she sat down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Now tell me what's amiss with me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I'm in love with somebody else," said she.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was my turn to jump out of my chair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's nobody in particular," she explained, laughing at the expression  of my face: "only an ideal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I've never met the kind of man I mean.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Tell me about him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What does he look like.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Oh, he might look very much like you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "How dear of you to say that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, what is it that he does that I  don't do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Just say the word,--teetotal, vegetarian, aeronaut,  theosophist, superman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll have a try at it, Gladys, if you will only  give me an idea what would please you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    She laughed at the elasticity of my character.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, in the first  place, I don't think my ideal would speak like that," said she.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"He  would be a harder, sterner man, not so ready to adapt himself to a  silly girl's whim.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But, above all, he must be a man who could do, who  could act, who could look Death in the face and have no fear of him, a  man of great deeds and strange experiences.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is never a man that I  should love, but always the glories he had won; for they would be  reflected upon me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Think of Richard Burton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I read his wife's  life of him I could so understand her love.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And Lady Stanley.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Did you  ever read the wonderful last chapter of that book about her husband.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These are the sort of men that a woman could worship with all her soul,  and yet be the greater, not the less, on account of her love, honored  by all the world as the inspirer of noble deeds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    She looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly brought down  the whole level of the interview.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I gripped myself hard, and went on  with the argument.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We can't all be Stanleys and Burtons," said I; "besides, we don't get  the chance,--at least, I never had the chance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If I did, I should try  to take it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But chances are all around you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is the mark of the kind of man I  mean that he makes his own chances.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You can't hold him back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I've  never met him, and yet I seem to know him so well.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are heroisms  all round us waiting to be done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's for men to do them, and for  women to reserve their love as a reward for such men.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Look at that  young Frenchman who went up last week in a balloon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was blowing a  gale of wind; but because he was announced to go he insisted on  starting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The wind blew him fifteen hundred miles in twenty-four  hours, and he fell in the middle of Russia.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That was the kind of man I  mean.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Think of the woman he loved, and how other women must have  envied her.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's what I should like to be,--envied for my man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I'd have done it to please you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But you shouldn't do it merely to please me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You should do it because  you can't help yourself, because it's natural to you, because the man  in you is crying out for heroic expression.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, when you described  the Wigan coal explosion last month, could you not have gone down and  helped those people, in spite of the choke-damp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I did.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You never said so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "There was nothing worth bucking about.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I didn't know.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  She looked at me with rather more interest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"That  was brave of you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I had to.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If you want to write good copy, you must be where the  things are.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What a prosaic motive.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It seems to take all the romance out of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But, still, whatever your motive, I am glad that you went down that  mine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  She gave me her hand; but with such sweetness and dignity that  I could only stoop and kiss it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I dare say I am merely a foolish  woman with a young girl's fancies.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet it is so real with me, so  entirely part of my very self, that I cannot help acting upon it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If I  marry, I do want to marry a famous man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Why should you not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is women like you who brace men up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Give me a chance, and see if I will take it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Besides, as you say, men  ought to MAKE their own chances, and not wait until they are given.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Look at Clive--just a clerk, and he conquered India.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll  do something in the world yet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    She laughed at my sudden Irish effervescence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Why not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" she said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You have everything a man could have,--youth, health, strength,  education, energy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was sorry you spoke.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And now I am glad--so  glad--if it wakens these thoughts in you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And if I do----"    Her dear hand rested like warm velvet upon my lips.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Not another word,  Sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You should have been at the office for evening duty half an hour  ago; only I hadn't the heart to remind you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some day, perhaps, when  you have won your place in the world, we shall talk it over again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    And so it was that I found myself that foggy November evening pursuing  the Camberwell tram with my heart glowing within me, and with the eager  determination that not another day should elapse before I should find  some deed which was worthy of my lady.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But who--who in all this wide  world could ever have imagined the incredible shape which that deed was  to take, or the strange steps by which I was led to the doing of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And, after all, this opening chapter will seem to the reader to have  nothing to do with my narrative; and yet there would have been no  narrative without it, for it is only when a man goes out into the world  with the thought that there are heroisms all round him, and with the  desire all alive in his heart to follow any which may come within sight  of him, that he breaks away as I did from the life he knows, and  ventures forth into the wonderful mystic twilight land where lie the  great adventures and the great rewards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behold me, then, at the office  of the Daily Gazette, on the staff of which I was a most insignificant  unit, with the settled determination that very night, if possible, to  find the quest which should be worthy of my Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Was it hardness,  was it selfishness, that she should ask me to risk my life for her own  glorification.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such thoughts may come to middle age; but never to  ardent three-and-twenty in the fever of his first love.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER II                "Try Your Luck with Professor Challenger"    I always liked McArdle, the crabbed, old, round-backed, red-headed news  editor, and I rather hoped that he liked me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of course, Beaumont was  the real boss; but he lived in the rarefied atmosphere of some Olympian  height from which he could distinguish nothing smaller than an  international crisis or a split in the Cabinet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sometimes we saw him  passing in lonely majesty to his inner sanctum, with his eyes staring  vaguely and his mind hovering over the Balkans or the Persian Gulf.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He  was above and beyond us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But McArdle was his first lieutenant, and it  was he that we knew.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The old man nodded as I entered the room, and he  pushed his spectacles far up on his bald forehead.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, from all I hear, you seem to be doing very well,"  said he in his kindly Scotch accent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I thanked him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The colliery explosion was excellent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So was the Southwark fire.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You  have the true descreeptive touch.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What did you want to see me about.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "To ask a favor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He looked alarmed, and his eyes shunned mine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Tut, tut.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What is it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Do you think, Sir, that you could possibly send me on some mission for  the paper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I would do my best to put it through and get you some good  copy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What sort of meesion had you in your mind, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, Sir, anything that had adventure and danger in it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I really  would do my very best.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The more difficult it was, the better it would  suit me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You seem very anxious to lose your life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "To justify my life, Sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Dear me, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, this is very--very exalted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm afraid the day  for this sort of thing is rather past.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The expense of the 'special  meesion' business hardly justifies the result, and, of course, in any  case it would only be an experienced man with a name that would command  public confidence who would get such an order.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The big blank spaces in  the map are all being filled in, and there's no room for romance  anywhere.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Wait a bit, though.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he added, with a sudden smile upon his  face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Talking of the blank spaces of the map gives me an idea.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What  about exposing a fraud--a modern Munchausen--and making him  rideeculous.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You could show him up as the liar that he is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Eh, man,  it would be fine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How does it appeal to you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Anything--anywhere--I care nothing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    McArdle was plunged in thought for some minutes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I wonder whether you could get on friendly--or at least on talking  terms with the fellow," he said, at last.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You seem to have a sort of  genius for establishing relations with people--seempathy, I suppose, or  animal magnetism, or youthful vitality, or something.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am conscious  of it myself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You are very good, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "So why should you not try your luck with Professor Challenger, of  Enmore Park.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I dare say I looked a little startled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Professor Challenger, the famous zoologist.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Wasn't he the man who broke the skull of Blundell, of the Telegraph.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The news editor smiled grimly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Do you mind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Didn't you say it was adventures you were after.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is all in the way of business, sir," I answered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Exactly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't suppose he can always be so violent as that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm  thinking that Blundell got him at the wrong moment, maybe, or in the  wrong fashion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You may have better luck, or more tact in handling him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There's something in your line there, I am sure, and the Gazette should  work it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I really know nothing about him," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I only remember his name  in connection with the police-court proceedings, for striking Blundell.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I have a few notes for your guidance, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I've had my eye on  the Professor for some little time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He took a paper from a drawer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Here is a summary of his record.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I give it you briefly:--    "'Challenger, George Edward.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Ex-President  Palaeontological Society.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Section H, British Association'--so on, so  on.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>--'Publications: "Some Observations Upon a Series of Kalmuck  Skulls"; "Outlines of Vertebrate Evolution"; and numerous papers,  including "The underlying fallacy of Weissmannism," which caused heated  discussion at the Zoological Congress of Vienna.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Address: Enmore Park, Kensington, W.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'    "There, take it with you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I've nothing more for you to-night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I pocketed the slip of paper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"One moment, sir," I said, as I realized that it was a pink bald head,  and not a red face, which was fronting me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am not very clear yet  why I am to interview this gentleman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What has he done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The face flashed back again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Went to South America on a solitary expedeetion two years ago.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Came  back last year.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Had undoubtedly been to South America, but refused to  say exactly where.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Began to tell his adventures in a vague way, but  somebody started to pick holes, and he just shut up like an oyster.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Something wonderful happened--or the man's a champion liar, which is  the more probable supposeetion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Had some damaged photographs, said to  be fakes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Got so touchy that he assaults anyone who asks questions,  and heaves reporters down the stairs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In my opinion he's just a  homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's your man, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, off you run, and see what you can make of him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You're  big enough to look after yourself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Anyway, you are all safe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Employers' Liability Act, you know.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    A grinning red face turned once more into a pink oval, fringed with  gingery fluff; the interview was at an end.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I walked across to the Savage Club, but instead of turning into it I  leaned upon the railings of Adelphi Terrace and gazed thoughtfully for  a long time at the brown, oily river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I can always think most sanely  and clearly in the open air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I took out the list of Professor  Challenger's exploits, and I read it over under the electric lamp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then I had what I can only regard as an inspiration.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As a Pressman, I  felt sure from what I had been told that I could never hope to get into  touch with this cantankerous Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But these recriminations,  twice mentioned in his skeleton biography, could only mean that he was  a fanatic in science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Was there not an exposed margin there upon which  he might be accessible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I would try.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I entered the club.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was just after eleven, and the big room was  fairly full, though the rush had not yet set in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I noticed a tall,  thin, angular man seated in an arm-chair by the fire.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He turned as I  drew my chair up to him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the man of all others whom I should  have chosen--Tarp Henry, of the staff of Nature, a thin, dry, leathery  creature, who was full, to those who knew him, of kindly humanity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  plunged instantly into my subject.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What do you know of Professor Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He gathered his brows in scientific disapproval.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Challenger was the man who came with some cock-and-bull story from  South America.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What story.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Oh, it was rank nonsense about some queer animals he had discovered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I believe he has retracted since.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Anyhow, he has suppressed it all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He gave an interview to Reuter's, and there was such a howl that he saw  it wouldn't do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a discreditable business.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were one or  two folk who were inclined to take him seriously, but he soon choked  them off.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "How.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was  poor old Wadley, of the Zoological Institute.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Wadley sent a message:  'The President of the Zoological Institute presents his compliments to  Professor Challenger, and would take it as a personal favor if he would  do them the honor to come to their next meeting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'  The answer was  unprintable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You don't say.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, a bowdlerized version of it would run:  'Professor Challenger  presents his compliments to the President of the Zoological Institute,  and would take it as a personal favor if he would go to the devil.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'"    "Good Lord.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Yes, I expect that's what old Wadley said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I remember his wail at the  meeting, which began:  'In fifty years experience of scientific  intercourse----'  It quite broke the old man up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Anything more about Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, I'm a bacteriologist, you know.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I live in a  nine-hundred-diameter microscope.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I can hardly claim to take serious  notice of anything that I can see with my naked eye.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm a  frontiersman from the extreme edge of the Knowable, and I feel quite  out of place when I leave my study and come into touch with all you  great, rough, hulking creatures.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm too detached to talk scandal, and  yet at scientific conversaziones I HAVE heard something of Challenger,  for he is one of those men whom nobody can ignore.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He's as clever as  they make 'em--a full-charged battery of force and vitality, but a  quarrelsome, ill-conditioned faddist, and unscrupulous at that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had  gone the length of faking some photographs over the South American  business.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You say he is a faddist.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What is his particular fad.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "He has a thousand, but the latest is something about Weissmann and  Evolution.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had a fearful row about it in Vienna, I believe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Can't you tell me the point.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Not at the moment, but a translation of the proceedings exists.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We  have it filed at the office.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Would you care to come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It's just what I want.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have to interview the fellow, and I need  some lead up to him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's really awfully good of you to give me a  lift.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll go with you now, if it is not too late.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"      Half an hour later I was seated in the newspaper office with a huge  tome in front of me, which had been opened at the article "Weissmann  versus Darwin," with the sub heading, "Spirited Protest at Vienna.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lively Proceedings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  My scientific education having been somewhat  neglected, I was unable to follow the whole argument, but it was  evident that the English Professor had handled his subject in a very  aggressive fashion, and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental  colleagues.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Protests," "Uproar," and "General appeal to the Chairman"  were three of the first brackets which caught my eye.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Most of the  matter might have been written in Chinese for any definite meaning that  it conveyed to my brain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I wish you could translate it into English for me," I said,  pathetically, to my help-mate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, it is a translation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then I'd better try my luck with the original.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is certainly rather deep for a layman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "If I could only get a single good, meaty sentence which seemed to  convey some sort of definite human idea, it would serve my turn.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Ah,  yes, this one will do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I seem in a vague way almost to understand it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll copy it out.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This shall be my link with the terrible Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Nothing else I can do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, yes; I propose to write to him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If I could frame the letter  here, and use your address it would give atmosphere.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We'll have the fellow round here making a row and breaking the  furniture.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No, no; you'll see the letter--nothing contentious, I assure you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, that's my chair and desk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You'll find paper there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'd like to  censor it before it goes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It took some doing, but I flatter myself that it wasn't such a bad job  when it was finished.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I read it aloud to the critical bacteriologist  with some pride in my handiwork.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"DEAR PROFESSOR CHALLENGER," it said, "As a humble student of Nature, I  have always taken the most profound interest in your speculations as to  the differences between Darwin and Weissmann.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have recently had  occasion to refresh my memory by re-reading----"      "You infernal liar.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" murmured Tarp Henry.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>--"by re-reading your masterly address at Vienna.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That lucid and  admirable statement seems to be the last word in the matter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There is  one sentence in it, however--namely:  'I protest strongly against the  insufferable and entirely dogmatic assertion that each separate id is a  microcosm possessed of an historical architecture elaborated slowly  through the series of generations.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>' Have you no desire, in view of  later research, to modify this statement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Do you not think that it is  over-accentuated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With your permission, I would ask the favor of an  interview, as I feel strongly upon the subject, and have certain  suggestions which I could only elaborate in a personal conversation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With your consent, I trust to have the honor of calling at eleven  o'clock the day after to-morrow (Wednesday) morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I remain, Sir, with assurances of profound respect, yours very truly,    EDWARD D.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>MALONE.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"      "How's that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked, triumphantly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well if your conscience can stand it----"    "It has never failed me yet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But what do you mean to do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "To get there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once I am in his room I may see some opening.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I may  even go the length of open confession.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If he is a sportsman he will be  tickled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Tickled, indeed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He's much more likely to do the tickling.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Chain  mail, or an American football suit--that's what you'll want.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well,  good-bye.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll have the answer for you here on Wednesday morning--if  he ever deigns to answer you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He is a violent, dangerous, cantankerous  character, hated by everyone who comes across him, and the butt of the  students, so far as they dare take a liberty with him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps it  would be best for you if you never heard from the fellow at all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"                                     CHAPTER III                  "He is a Perfectly Impossible Person"    My friend's fear or hope was not destined to be realized.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I  called on Wednesday there was a letter with the West Kensington  postmark upon it, and my name scrawled across the envelope in a  handwriting which looked like a barbed-wire railing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The contents were  as follows:--                                    "ENMORE PARK, W.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"SIR,--I have duly received your note, in which you claim to endorse my  views, although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement  either from you or anyone else.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You have ventured to use the word  'speculation' with regard to my statement upon the subject of  Darwinism, and I would call your attention to the fact that such a word  in such a connection is offensive to a degree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The context convinces  me, however, that you have sinned rather through ignorance and  tactlessness than through malice, so I am content to pass the matter  by.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture, and appear to have  some difficulty in understanding it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I should have thought that only a  sub-human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point, but if it  really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour  named, though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding  distasteful to me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion,  I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a  deliberate expression of my mature views.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You will kindly show the  envelope of this letter to my man, Austin, when you call, as he has to  take every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call  themselves 'journalists.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'                              "Yours faithfully,                              "GEORGE EDWARD CHALLENGER.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"      This was the letter that I read aloud to Tarp Henry, who had come down  early to hear the result of my venture.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His only remark was, "There's  some new stuff, cuticura or something, which is better than arnica.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  Some people have such extraordinary notions of humor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was nearly half-past ten before I had received my message, but a  taxicab took me round in good time for my appointment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was an  imposing porticoed house at which we stopped, and the heavily-curtained  windows gave every indication of wealth upon the part of this  formidable Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The door was opened by an odd, swarthy, dried-up  person of uncertain age, with a dark pilot jacket and brown leather  gaiters.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I found afterwards that he was the chauffeur, who filled the  gaps left by a succession of fugitive butlers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He looked me up and  down with a searching light blue eye.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Expected.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"An appointment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Got your letter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I produced the envelope.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He seemed to be a person of few words.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Following him down  the passage I was suddenly interrupted by a small woman, who stepped  out from what proved to be the dining-room door.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>She was a bright,  vivacious, dark-eyed lady, more French than English in her type.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"One moment," she said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You can wait, Austin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Step in here, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>May I ask if you have met my husband before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No, madam, I have not had the honor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then I apologize to you in advance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I must tell you that he is a  perfectly impossible person--absolutely impossible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If you are  forewarned you will be the more ready to make allowances.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is most considerate of you, madam.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Get quickly out of the room if he seems inclined to be violent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't  wait to argue with him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Several people have been injured through doing  that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Afterwards there is a public scandal and it reflects upon me and  all of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I suppose it wasn't about South America you wanted to see  him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I could not lie to a lady.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Dear me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That is his most dangerous subject.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You won't believe a  word he says--I'm sure I don't wonder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But don't tell him so, for it  makes him very violent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Pretend to believe him, and you may get  through all right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Remember he believes it himself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of that you may  be assured.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A more honest man never lived.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't wait any longer or  he may suspect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If you find him dangerous--really dangerous--ring the  bell and hold him off until I come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even at his worst I can usually  control him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    With these encouraging words the lady handed me over to the taciturn  Austin, who had waited like a bronze statue of discretion during our  short interview, and I was conducted to the end of the passage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There  was a tap at a door, a bull's bellow from within, and I was face to  face with the Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He sat in a rotating chair behind a broad table, which was covered with  books, maps, and diagrams.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I entered, his seat spun round to face  me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His appearance made me gasp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was prepared for something  strange, but not for so overpowering a personality as this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was his  size which took one's breath away--his size and his imposing presence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His head was enormous, the largest I have ever seen upon a human being.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am sure that his top-hat, had I ever ventured to don it, would have  slipped over me entirely and rested on my shoulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had the face  and beard which I associate with an Assyrian bull; the former florid,  the latter so black as almost to have a suspicion of blue, spade-shaped  and rippling down over his chest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The hair was peculiar, plastered  down in front in a long, curving wisp over his massive forehead.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  eyes were blue-gray under great black tufts, very clear, very critical,  and very masterful.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A huge spread of shoulders and a chest like a  barrel were the other parts of him which appeared above the table, save  for two enormous hands covered with long black hair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This and a  bellowing, roaring, rumbling voice made up my first impression of the  notorious Professor Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he, with a most insolent stare.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I must keep up my deception for at least a little time longer,  otherwise here was evidently an end of the interview.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You were good enough to give me an appointment, sir," said I, humbly,  producing his envelope.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He took my letter from his desk and laid it out before him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Oh, you are the young person who cannot understand plain English, are  you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My general conclusions you are good enough to approve, as I  understand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Entirely, sir--entirely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  I was very emphatic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Dear me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That strengthens my position very much, does it not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Your  age and appearance make your support doubly valuable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, at least  you are better than that herd of swine in Vienna, whose gregarious  grunt is, however, not more offensive than the isolated effort of the  British hog.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He glared at me as the present representative of the  beast.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"They seem to have behaved abominably," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I assure you that I can fight my own battles, and that I have no  possible need of your sympathy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Put me alone, sir, and with my back to  the wall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>G.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>E.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>C.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>is happiest then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, sir, let us do what we can  to curtail this visit, which can hardly be agreeable to you, and is  inexpressibly irksome to me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You had, as I have been led to believe,  some comments to make upon the proposition which I advanced in my  thesis.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    There was a brutal directness about his methods which made evasion  difficult.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I must still make play and wait for a better opening.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  had seemed simple enough at a distance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Oh, my Irish wits, could they  not help me now, when I needed help so sorely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He transfixed me with  two sharp, steely eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Come, come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he rumbled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am, of course, a mere student," said I, with a fatuous smile,  "hardly more, I might say, than an earnest inquirer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At the same time,  it seemed to me that you were a little severe upon Weissmann in this  matter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Has not the general evidence since that date tended to--well,  to strengthen his position.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What evidence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He spoke with a menacing calm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, of course, I am aware that there is not any what you might call  DEFINITE evidence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I alluded merely to the trend of modern thought and  the general scientific point of view, if I might so express it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He leaned forward with great earnestness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I suppose you are aware," said he, checking off points upon his  fingers, "that the cranial index is a constant factor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Naturally," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"And that telegony is still sub judice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Undoubtedly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And that the germ plasm is different from the parthenogenetic egg.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Why, surely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried, and gloried in my own audacity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But what does that prove.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he asked, in a gentle, persuasive voice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Ah, what indeed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I murmured.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What does it prove.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Shall I tell you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cooed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Pray do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It proves," he roared, with a sudden blast of fury, "that you are the  damnedest imposter in London--a vile, crawling journalist, who has no  more science than he has decency in his composition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He had sprung to his feet with a mad rage in his eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even at that  moment of tension I found time for amazement at the discovery that he  was quite a short man, his head not higher than my shoulder--a stunted  Hercules whose tremendous vitality had all run to depth, breadth, and  brain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Gibberish.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried, leaning forward, with his fingers on the table  and his face projecting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"That's what I have been talking to you,  sir--scientific gibberish.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Did you think you could match cunning with  me--you with your walnut of a brain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You think you are omnipotent, you  infernal scribblers, don't you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That your praise can make a man and  your blame can break him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We must all bow to you, and try to get a  favorable word, must we.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This man shall have a leg up, and this man  shall have a dressing down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Creeping vermin, I know you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You've got  out of your station.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Time was when your ears were clipped.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You've  lost your sense of proportion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Swollen gas-bags.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll keep you in  your proper place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yes, sir, you haven't got over G.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>E.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>C.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There's  one man who is still your master.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He warned you off, but if you WILL  come, by the Lord you do it at your own risk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Forfeit, my good Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, I claim forfeit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You have played a rather dangerous game, and  it strikes me that you have lost it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Look here, sir," said I, backing to the door and opening it; "you can  be as abusive as you like.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But there is a limit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You shall not  assault me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Shall I not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He was slowly advancing in a peculiarly menacing way,  but he stopped now and put his big hands into the side-pockets of a  rather boyish short jacket which he wore.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I have thrown several of  you out of the house.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You will be the fourth or fifth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Three pound  fifteen each--that is how it averaged.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Expensive, but very necessary.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, sir, why should you not follow your brethren.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I rather think you  must.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He resumed his unpleasant and stealthy advance, pointing his  toes as he walked, like a dancing master.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could have bolted for the hall door, but it would have been too  ignominious.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Besides, a little glow of righteous anger was springing  up within me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had been hopelessly in the wrong before, but this  man's menaces were putting me in the right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I'll trouble you to keep your hands off, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll not stand it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Dear me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  His black moustache lifted and a white fang twinkled in a  sneer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You won't stand it, eh.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Don't be such a fool, Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What can you hope for.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm fifteen stone, as hard as nails, and play center three-quarter  every Saturday for the London Irish.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm not the man----"    It was at that moment that he rushed me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was lucky that I had  opened the door, or we should have gone through it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We did a  Catharine-wheel together down the passage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Somehow we gathered up a  chair upon our way, and bounded on with it towards the street.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My  mouth was full of  his beard, our arms were locked, our bodies  intertwined, and that infernal chair radiated its legs all round us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The watchful Austin had thrown open the hall door.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We went with a back  somersault down the front steps.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have seen the two Macs attempt  something of the kind at the halls, but it appears to take some  practise to do it without hurting oneself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The chair went to matchwood  at the bottom, and we rolled apart into the gutter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He sprang to his  feet, waving his fists and wheezing like an asthmatic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Had enough.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he panted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You infernal bully.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried, as I gathered myself together.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then and there we should have tried the thing out, for he was  effervescing with fight, but fortunately I was rescued from an odious  situation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A policeman was beside us, his notebook in his hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What's all this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You ought to be ashamed" said the policeman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  the most rational remark which I had heard in Enmore Park.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well," he  insisted, turning to me, "what is it, then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "This man attacked me," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Did you attack him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" asked the policeman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Professor breathed hard and said nothing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's not the first time, either," said the policeman, severely,  shaking his head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You were in trouble last month for the same thing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You've blackened this young man's eye.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Do you give him in charge, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I relented.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No," said I, "I do not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What's that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said the policeman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I was to blame myself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I intruded upon him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He gave me fair warning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The policeman snapped up his notebook.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Don't let us have any more such goings-on," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Now, then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Move on, there, move on.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  This to a butcher's boy, a maid, and one or  two loafers who had collected.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He clumped heavily down the street,  driving this little flock before him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Professor looked at me, and  there was something humorous at the back of his eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Come in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I've not done with you yet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The speech had a sinister sound, but I followed him none the less into  the house.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The man-servant, Austin, like a wooden image, closed the  door behind us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER IV             "It's Just the very Biggest Thing in the World"    Hardly was it shut when Mrs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger darted out from the  dining-room.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The small woman was in a furious temper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>She barred her  husband's way like an enraged chicken in front of a bulldog.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  evident that she had seen my exit, but had not observed my return.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You brute, George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" she screamed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You've hurt that nice young man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He jerked backwards with his thumb.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Here he is, safe and sound behind me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    She was confused, but not unduly so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am so sorry, I didn't see you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I assure you, madam, that it is all right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "He has marked your poor face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Oh, George, what a brute you are.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Nothing but scandals from one end of the week to the other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Everyone  hating and making fun of you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You've finished my patience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This ends  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Dirty linen," he rumbled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's not a secret," she cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Do you suppose that the whole  street--the whole of London, for that matter----  Get away, Austin, we  don't want you here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Do you suppose they don't all talk about you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Where is your dignity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You, a man who should have been Regius  Professor at a great University with a thousand students all revering  you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Where is your dignity, George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "How about yours, my dear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You try me too much.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A ruffian--a common brawling ruffian--that's  what you have become.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Be good, Jessie.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A roaring, raging bully.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "That's done it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Stool of penance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To my amazement he stooped, picked her up, and placed her sitting upon  a high pedestal of black marble in the angle of the hall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was at  least seven feet high, and so thin that she could hardly balance upon  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A more absurd object than she presented cocked up there with her  face convulsed with anger, her feet dangling, and her body rigid for  fear of an upset, I could not imagine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Let me down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" she wailed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Say 'please.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'"    "You brute, George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let me down this instant.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Come into the study, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Really, sir----.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said I, looking at the lady.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Here's Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone pleading for you, Jessie.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Say 'please,' and down  you come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Oh, you brute.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Please.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>please.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He took her down as if she had been a canary.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You must behave yourself, dear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone is a Pressman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He will  have it all in his rag to-morrow, and sell an extra dozen among our  neighbors.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'Strange story of high life'--you felt fairly high on that  pedestal, did you not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then a sub-title, 'Glimpse of a singular  menage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'  He's a foul feeder, is Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, a carrion eater, like all  of his kind--porcus ex grege diaboli--a swine from the devil's herd.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's it, Malone--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You are really intolerable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said I, hotly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He bellowed with laughter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We shall have a coalition presently," he boomed, looking from his wife  to me and puffing out his enormous chest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, suddenly altering his  tone, "Excuse this frivolous family badinage, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I called you  back for some more serious purpose than to mix you up with our little  domestic pleasantries.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Run away, little woman, and don't fret.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He  placed a huge hand upon each of her shoulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"All that you say is  perfectly true.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I should be a better man if I did what you advise, but  I shouldn't be quite George Edward Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are plenty of  better men, my dear, but only one G.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>E.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>C.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So make the best of him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He suddenly gave her a resounding kiss, which embarrassed me even more  than his violence had done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Now, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone," he continued, with a  great accession of dignity, "this way, if YOU please.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    We re-entered the room which we had left so tumultuously ten minutes  before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Professor closed the door carefully behind us, motioned me  into an arm-chair, and pushed a cigar-box under my nose.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Real San Juan Colorado," he said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Excitable people like you are the  better for narcotics.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Heavens.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>don't bite it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Cut--and cut with  reverence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now lean back, and listen attentively to whatever I may  care to say to you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If any remark should occur to you, you can reserve  it for some more opportune time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"First of all, as to your return to my house after your most  justifiable expulsion"--he protruded his beard, and stared at me as one  who challenges and invites contradiction--"after, as I say, your  well-merited expulsion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The reason lay in your answer to that most  officious policeman, in which I seemed to discern some glimmering of  good feeling upon your part--more, at any rate, than I am accustomed to  associate with your profession.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In admitting that the fault of the  incident lay with you, you gave some evidence of a certain mental  detachment and breadth of view which attracted my favorable notice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The sub-species of the human race to which you unfortunately belong has  always been below my mental horizon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Your words brought you suddenly  above it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You swam up into my serious notice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For this reason I asked  you to return with me, as I was minded to make your further  acquaintance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You will kindly deposit your ash in the small Japanese  tray on the bamboo table which stands at your left elbow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    All this he boomed forth like a professor addressing his class.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had  swung round his revolving chair so as to face me, and he sat all puffed  out like an enormous bull-frog, his head laid back and his eyes  half-covered by supercilious lids.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now he suddenly turned himself  sideways, and all I could see of him was tangled hair with a red,  protruding ear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was scratching about among the litter of papers  upon his desk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He faced me presently with what looked like a very  tattered sketch-book in his hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am going to talk to you about South America," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No comments  if you please.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>First of all, I wish you to understand that nothing I  tell you now is to be repeated in any public way unless you have my  express permission.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That permission will, in all human probability,  never be given.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Is that clear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is very hard," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Surely a judicious account----"    He replaced the notebook upon the table.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"That ends it," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I wish you a very good morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No, no.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I submit to any conditions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So far as I can see,  I have no choice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "None in the world," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, then, I promise.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Word of honor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Word of honor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He looked at me with doubt in his insolent eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"After all, what do I know about your honor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Upon my word, sir," I cried, angrily, "you take very great liberties.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have never been so insulted in my life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He seemed more interested than annoyed at my outbreak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Round-headed," he muttered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Brachycephalic, gray-eyed, black-haired,  with suggestion of the negroid.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Celtic, I presume.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I am an Irishman, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Irish Irish.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Yes, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "That, of course, explains it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let me see; you have given me your  promise that my confidence will be respected.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That confidence, I may  say, will be far from complete.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I am prepared to give you a few  indications which will be of interest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the first place, you are  probably aware that two years ago I made a journey to South  America--one which will be classical in the scientific history of the  world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The object of my journey was to verify some conclusions of  Wallace and of Bates, which could only be done by observing their  reported facts under the same conditions in which they had themselves  noted them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If my expedition had no other results it would still have  been noteworthy, but a curious incident occurred to me while there  which opened up an entirely fresh line of inquiry.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You are aware--or probably, in this half-educated age, you are not  aware--that the country round some parts of the Amazon is still only  partially explored, and that a great number of tributaries, some of  them entirely uncharted, run into the main river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was my business  to visit this little-known back-country and to examine its fauna, which  furnished me with the materials for several chapters for that great and  monumental work upon zoology which will be my life's justification.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  was returning, my work accomplished, when I had occasion to spend a  night at a small Indian village at a point where a certain  tributary--the name and position of which I withhold--opens into the  main river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The natives were Cucama Indians, an amiable but degraded  race, with mental powers hardly superior to the average Londoner.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  had effected some cures among them upon my way up the river, and had  impressed them considerably with my personality, so that I was not  surprised to find myself eagerly awaited upon my return.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I gathered  from their signs that someone had urgent need of my medical services,  and I followed the chief to one of his huts.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I entered I found  that the sufferer to whose aid I had been summoned had that instant  expired.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was, to my surprise, no Indian, but a white man; indeed, I  may say a very white man, for he was flaxen-haired and had some  characteristics of an albino.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was clad in rags, was very emaciated,  and bore every trace of prolonged hardship.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So far as I could  understand the account of the natives, he was a complete stranger to  them, and had come upon their village through the woods alone and in  the last stage of exhaustion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The man's knapsack lay beside the couch, and I examined the contents.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His name was written upon a tab within it--Maple White, Lake Avenue,  Detroit, Michigan.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is a name to which I am prepared always to lift  my hat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is not too much to say that it will rank level with my own  when the final credit of this business comes to be apportioned.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"From the contents of the knapsack it was evident that this man had  been an artist and poet in search of effects.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were scraps of  verse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I do not profess to be a judge of such things, but they  appeared to me to be singularly wanting in merit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were also some  rather commonplace pictures of river scenery, a paint-box, a box of  colored chalks, some brushes, that curved bone which lies upon my  inkstand, a volume of Baxter's 'Moths and Butterflies,' a cheap  revolver, and a few cartridges.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of personal equipment he either had  none or he had lost it in his journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such were the total effects of  this strange American Bohemian.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I was turning away from him when I observed that something projected  from the front of his ragged jacket.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was this sketch-book, which  was as dilapidated then as you see it now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Indeed, I can assure you  that a first folio of Shakespeare could not be treated with greater  reverence than this relic has been since it came into my possession.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  hand it to you now, and I ask you to take it page by page and to  examine the contents.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He helped himself to a cigar and leaned back with a fiercely critical  pair of eyes, taking note of the effect which this document would  produce.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had opened the volume with some expectation of a revelation, though  of what nature I could not imagine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The first page was disappointing,  however, as it contained nothing but the picture of a very fat man in a  pea-jacket, with the legend, "Jimmy Colver on the Mail-boat," written  beneath it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There followed several pages which were filled with small  sketches of Indians and their ways.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then came a picture of a cheerful  and corpulent ecclesiastic in a shovel hat, sitting opposite a very  thin European, and the inscription:  "Lunch with Fra Cristofero at  Rosario.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  Studies of women and babies accounted for several more  pages, and then there was an unbroken series of animal drawings with  such explanations as "Manatee upon Sandbank," "Turtles and Their Eggs,"  "Black Ajouti under a Miriti Palm"--the matter disclosing some sort of  pig-like animal; and finally came a double page of studies of  long-snouted and very unpleasant saurians.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could make nothing of it,  and said so to the Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Surely these are only crocodiles.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Alligators.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Alligators.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There is hardly such a thing as a true  crocodile in South America.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The distinction between them----"    "I meant that I could see nothing unusual--nothing to justify what you  have said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He smiled serenely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Try the next page," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was still unable to sympathize.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a full-page sketch of a  landscape roughly tinted in color--the kind of painting which an  open-air artist takes as a guide to a future more elaborate effort.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a pale-green foreground of feathery vegetation, which sloped  upwards and ended in a line of cliffs dark red in color, and curiously  ribbed like some basaltic formations which I have seen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They extended  in an unbroken wall right across the background.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At one point was an  isolated pyramidal rock, crowned by a great tree, which appeared to be  separated by a cleft from the main crag.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behind it all, a blue  tropical sky.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A thin green line of vegetation fringed the summit of  the ruddy cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is no doubt a curious formation," said I "but I am not geologist  enough to say that it is wonderful.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Wonderful.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he repeated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is unique.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is incredible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No one on  earth has ever dreamed of such a possibility.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now the next.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I turned it over, and gave an exclamation of surprise.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a  full-page picture of the most extraordinary creature that I had ever  seen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the wild dream of an opium smoker, a vision of delirium.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The head was like that of a fowl, the body that of a bloated lizard,  the trailing tail was furnished with upward-turned spikes, and the  curved back was edged with a high serrated fringe, which looked like a  dozen cocks' wattles placed behind each other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In front of this  creature was an absurd mannikin, or dwarf, in human form, who stood  staring at it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, what do you think of that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried the Professor, rubbing his  hands with an air of triumph.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is monstrous--grotesque.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But what made him draw such an animal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Trade gin, I should think.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Oh, that's the best explanation you can give, is it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, sir, what is yours.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "The obvious one that the creature exists.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That is actually sketched  from the life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I should have laughed only that I had a vision of our doing another  Catharine-wheel down the passage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No doubt," said I, "no doubt," as one humors an imbecile.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I confess,  however," I added, "that this tiny human figure puzzles me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If it were  an Indian we could set it down as evidence of some pigmy race in  America, but it appears to be a European in a sun-hat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The Professor snorted like an angry buffalo.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You really touch the  limit," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You enlarge my view of the possible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Cerebral  paresis.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Mental inertia.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Wonderful.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He was too absurd to make me angry.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Indeed, it was a waste of energy,  for if you were going to be angry with this man you would be angry all  the time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I contented myself with smiling wearily.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It struck me that  the man was small," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Look here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried, leaning forward and dabbing a great hairy  sausage of a finger on to the picture.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You see that plant behind the  animal; I suppose you thought it was a dandelion or a Brussels  sprout--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, it is a vegetable ivory palm, and they run to  about fifty or sixty feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't you see that the man is put in for a  purpose.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He couldn't really have stood in front of that brute and  lived to draw it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He sketched himself in to give a scale of heights.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was, we will say, over five feet high.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The tree is ten times  bigger, which is what one would expect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Good heavens.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Then you think the beast was---- Why,  Charing Cross station would hardly make a kennel for such a brute.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Apart from exaggeration, he is certainly a well-grown specimen," said  the Professor, complacently.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But," I cried, "surely the whole experience of the human race is not  to be set aside on account of a single sketch"--I had turned over the  leaves and ascertained that there was nothing more in the book--"a  single sketch by a wandering American artist who may have done it under  hashish, or in the delirium of fever, or simply in order to gratify a  freakish imagination.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You can't, as a man of science, defend such a  position as that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    For answer the Professor took a book down from a shelf.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"This is an excellent monograph by my gifted friend, Ray Lankester.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"There is an illustration here which would interest you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Ah,  yes, here it is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The inscription beneath it runs:  'Probable  appearance in life of the Jurassic Dinosaur Stegosaurus.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The hind leg  alone is twice as tall as a full-grown man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'  Well, what do you make of  that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He handed me the open book.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I started as I looked at the picture.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In  this reconstructed animal of a dead world there was certainly a very  great resemblance to the sketch of the unknown artist.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"That is certainly remarkable," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But you won't admit that it is final.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Surely it might be a coincidence, or this American may have seen a  picture of the kind and carried it in his memory.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It would be likely  to recur to a man in a delirium.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Very good," said the Professor, indulgently; "we leave it at that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  will now ask you to look at this bone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He handed over the one which he  had already described as part of the dead man's possessions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  about six inches long, and thicker than my thumb, with some indications  of dried cartilage at one end of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"To what known creature does that bone belong.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" asked the Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I examined it with care and tried to recall some half-forgotten  knowledge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It might be a very thick human collar-bone," I said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My companion waved his hand in contemptuous deprecation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The human collar-bone is curved.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This is straight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There is a groove  upon its surface showing that a great tendon played across it, which  could not be the case with a clavicle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then I must confess that I don't know what it is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You need not be ashamed to expose your ignorance, for I don't suppose  the whole South Kensington staff could give a name to it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He took a  little bone the size of a bean out of a pill-box.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"So far as I am a  judge this human bone is the analogue of the one which you hold in your  hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That will give you some idea of the size of the creature.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You  will observe from the cartilage that this is no fossil specimen, but  recent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What do you say to that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Surely in an elephant----"    He winced as if in pain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Don't.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't talk of elephants in South America.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even in these days  of Board schools----"    "Well," I interrupted, "any large South American animal--a tapir, for  example.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You may take it, young man, that I am versed in the elements of my  business.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This is not a conceivable bone either of a tapir or of any  other creature known to zoology.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It belongs to a very large, a very  strong, and, by all analogy, a very fierce animal which exists upon the  face of the earth, but has not yet come under the notice of science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You are still unconvinced.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I am at least deeply interested.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then your case is not hopeless.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I feel that there is reason lurking  in you somewhere, so we will patiently grope round for it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We will now  leave the dead American and proceed with my narrative.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You can imagine  that I could hardly come away from the Amazon without probing deeper  into the matter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were indications as to the direction from which  the dead traveler had come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Indian legends would alone have been my  guide, for I found that rumors of a strange land were common among all  the riverine tribes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You have heard, no doubt, of Curupuri.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Never.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Curupuri is the spirit of the woods, something terrible, something  malevolent, something to be avoided.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>None can describe its shape or  nature, but it is a word of terror along the Amazon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now all tribes  agree as to the direction in which Curupuri lives.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the same  direction from which the American had come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Something terrible lay  that way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was my business to find out what it was.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What did you do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  My flippancy was all gone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This massive man  compelled one's attention and respect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I overcame the extreme reluctance of the natives--a reluctance which  extends even to talk upon the subject--and by judicious persuasion and  gifts, aided, I will admit, by some threats of coercion, I got two of  them to act as guides.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After many adventures which I need not  describe, and after traveling a distance which I will not mention, in a  direction which I withhold, we came at last to a tract of country which  has never been described, nor, indeed, visited save by my unfortunate  predecessor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Would you kindly look at this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He handed me a photograph--half-plate size.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The unsatisfactory appearance of it is due to the fact," said he,  "that on descending the river the boat was upset and the case which  contained the undeveloped films was broken, with disastrous results.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Nearly all of them were totally ruined--an irreparable loss.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This is  one of the few which partially escaped.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This explanation of  deficiencies or abnormalities you will kindly accept.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was talk  of faking.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am not in a mood to argue such a point.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The photograph was certainly very off-colored.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>An unkind critic might  easily have misinterpreted that dim surface.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a dull gray  landscape, and as I gradually deciphered the details of it I realized  that it represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly  like an immense cataract seen in the distance, with a sloping,  tree-clad plain in the foreground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I believe it is the same place as the painted picture," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is the same place," the Professor answered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I found traces of the  fellow's camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now look at this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was a nearer view of the same scene, though the photograph was  extremely defective.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could distinctly see the isolated, tree-crowned  pinnacle of rock which was detached from the crag.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I have no doubt of it at all," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, that is something gained," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We progress, do we not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, will you please look at the top of that rocky pinnacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Do you  observe something there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "An enormous tree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But on the tree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A large bird," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He handed me a lens.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Yes," I said, peering through it, "a large bird stands on the tree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It appears to have a considerable beak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I should say it was a pelican.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I cannot congratulate you upon your eyesight," said the Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is not a pelican, nor, indeed, is it a bird.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It may interest you  to know that I succeeded in shooting that particular specimen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  the only absolute proof of my experiences which I was able to bring  away with me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You have it, then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  Here at last was tangible corroboration.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I had it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was unfortunately lost with so much else in the same  boat accident which ruined my photographs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I clutched at it as it  disappeared in the swirl of the rapids, and part of its wing was left  in my hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was insensible when washed ashore, but the miserable  remnant of my superb specimen was still intact; I now lay it before  you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    From a drawer he produced what seemed to me to be the upper portion of  the wing of a large bat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was at least two feet in length, a curved  bone, with a membranous veil beneath it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"A monstrous bat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I suggested.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Nothing of the sort," said the Professor, severely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Living, as I do,  in an educated and scientific atmosphere, I could not have conceived  that the first principles of zoology were so little known.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Is it  possible that you do not know the elementary fact in comparative  anatomy, that the wing of a bird is really the forearm, while the wing  of a bat consists of three elongated fingers with membranes between.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, in this case, the bone is certainly not the forearm, and you can  see for yourself that this is a single membrane hanging upon a single  bone, and therefore that it cannot belong to a bat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But if it is  neither bird nor bat, what is it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    My small stock of knowledge was exhausted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I really do not know," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He opened the standard work to which he had already referred me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Here," said he, pointing to the picture of an extraordinary flying  monster, "is an excellent reproduction of the dimorphodon, or  pterodactyl, a flying reptile of the Jurassic period.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the next page  is a diagram of the mechanism of its wing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Kindly compare it with the  specimen in your hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    A wave of amazement passed over me as I looked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was convinced.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There could be no getting away from it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The cumulative proof was  overwhelming.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The sketch, the photographs, the narrative, and now the  actual specimen--the evidence was complete.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I said so--I said so  warmly, for I felt that the Professor was an ill-used man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He leaned  back in his chair with drooping eyelids and a tolerant smile, basking  in this sudden gleam of sunshine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's just the very biggest thing that I ever heard of.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said I, though  it was my journalistic rather than my scientific enthusiasm that was  roused.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is colossal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You are a Columbus of science who has  discovered a lost world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm awfully sorry if I seemed to doubt you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was all so unthinkable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I understand evidence when I see it,  and this should be good enough for anyone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The Professor purred with satisfaction.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"And then, sir, what did you do next.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It was the wet season, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, and my stores were exhausted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  explored some portion of this huge cliff, but I was unable to find any  way to scale it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The pyramidal rock upon which I saw and shot the  pterodactyl was more accessible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Being something of a cragsman, I did  manage to get half way to the top of that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From that height I had a  better idea of the plateau upon the top of the crags.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It appeared to  be very large; neither to east nor to west could I see any end to the  vista of green-capped cliffs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Below, it is a swampy, jungly region,  full of snakes, insects, and fever.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is a natural protection to this  singular country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Did you see any other trace of life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No, sir, I did not; but during the week that we lay encamped at the  base of the cliff we heard some very strange noises from above.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But the creature that the American drew.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How do you account for that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We can only suppose that he must have made his way to the summit and  seen it there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We know, therefore, that there is a way up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We know  equally that it must be a very difficult one, otherwise the creatures  would have come down and overrun the surrounding country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Surely that  is clear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But how did they come to be there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I do not think that the problem is a very obscure one," said the  Professor; "there can only be one explanation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>South America is, as  you may have heard, a granite continent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At this single point in the  interior there has been, in some far distant age, a great, sudden  volcanic upheaval.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These cliffs, I may remark, are basaltic, and  therefore plutonic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>An area, as large perhaps as Sussex, has been  lifted up en bloc with all its living contents, and cut off by  perpendicular precipices of a hardness which defies erosion from all  the rest of the continent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What is the result.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why, the ordinary laws  of Nature are suspended.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The various checks which influence the  struggle for existence in the world at large are all neutralized or  altered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Creatures survive which would otherwise disappear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You will  observe that both the pterodactyl and the stegosaurus are Jurassic, and  therefore of a great age in the order of life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They have been  artificially conserved by those strange accidental conditions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But surely your evidence is conclusive.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You have only to lay it  before the proper authorities.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "So in my simplicity, I had imagined," said the Professor, bitterly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I can only tell you that it was not so, that I was met at every turn  by incredulity, born partly of stupidity and partly of jealousy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is  not my nature, sir, to cringe to any man, or to seek to prove a fact if  my word has been doubted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After the first I have not condescended to  show such corroborative proofs as I possess.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The subject became  hateful to me--I would not speak of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When men like yourself, who  represent the foolish curiosity of the public, came to disturb my  privacy I was unable to meet them with dignified reserve.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By nature I  am, I admit, somewhat fiery, and under provocation I am inclined to be  violent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I fear you may have remarked it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I nursed my eye and was silent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"My wife has frequently remonstrated with me upon the subject, and yet  I fancy that any man of honor would feel the same.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To-night, however,  I propose to give an extreme example of the control of the will over  the emotions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I invite you to be present at the exhibition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He  handed me a card from his desk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You will perceive that Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Percival  Waldron, a naturalist of some popular repute, is announced to lecture  at eight-thirty at the Zoological Institute's Hall upon 'The Record of  the Ages.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>' I have been specially invited to be present upon the  platform, and to move a vote of thanks to the lecturer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>While doing  so, I shall make it my business, with infinite tact and delicacy, to  throw out a few remarks which may arouse the interest of the audience  and cause some of them to desire to go more deeply into the matter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Nothing contentious, you understand, but only an indication that there  are greater deeps beyond.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I shall hold myself strongly in leash, and  see whether by this self-restraint I attain a more favorable result.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And I may come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked eagerly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Why, surely," he answered, cordially.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had an enormously massive  genial manner, which was almost as overpowering as his violence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His  smile of benevolence was a wonderful thing, when his cheeks would  suddenly bunch into two red apples, between his half-closed eyes and  his great black beard.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"By all means, come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It will be a comfort to  me to know that I have one ally in the hall, however inefficient and  ignorant of the subject he may be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I fancy there will be a large  audience, for Waldron, though an absolute charlatan, has a considerable  popular following.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, I have given you rather more of my  time than I had intended.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The individual must not monopolize what is  meant for the world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I shall be pleased to see you at the lecture  to-night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the meantime, you will understand that no public use is  to be made of any of the material that I have given you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>McArdle--my news editor, you know--will want to know what I  have done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Tell him what you like.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You can say, among other things, that if he  sends anyone else to intrude upon me I shall call upon him with a  riding-whip.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I leave it to you that nothing of all this appears in  print.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Very good.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then the Zoological Institute's Hall at  eight-thirty to-night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  I had a last impression of red cheeks, blue  rippling beard, and intolerant eyes, as he waved me out of the room.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER V                               "Question.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    What with the physical shocks incidental to my first interview with  Professor Challenger and the mental ones which accompanied the second,  I was a somewhat demoralized journalist by the time I found myself in  Enmore Park once more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In my aching head the one thought was throbbing  that there really was truth in this man's story, that it was of  tremendous consequence, and that it would work up into inconceivable  copy for the Gazette when I could obtain permission to use it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A  taxicab was waiting at the end of the road, so I sprang into it and  drove down to the office.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>McArdle was at his post as usual.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well," he cried, expectantly, "what may it run to.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm thinking,  young man, you have been in the wars.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't tell me that he assaulted  you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We had a little difference at first.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What a man it is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What did you do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, he became more reasonable and we had a chat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I got nothing  out of him--nothing for publication.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I'm not so sure about that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You got a black eye out of him, and  that's for publication.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We can't have this reign of terror, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We must bring the man to his bearings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll have a leaderette  on him to-morrow that will raise a blister.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Just give me the material  and I will engage to brand the fellow for ever.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor  Munchausen--how's that for an inset headline.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sir John Mandeville  redivivus--Cagliostro--all the imposters and bullies in history.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll  show him up for the fraud he is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I wouldn't do that, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Why not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Because he is not a fraud at all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" roared McArdle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You don't mean to say you really believe this  stuff of his about mammoths and mastodons and great sea sairpents.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, I don't know about that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't think he makes any claims of  that kind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I do believe he has got something new.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then for Heaven's sake, man, write it up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I'm longing to, but all I know he gave me in confidence and on  condition that I didn't.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  I condensed into a few sentences the  Professor's narrative.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"That's how it stands.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    McArdle looked deeply incredulous.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone," he said at last, "about this scientific meeting  to-night; there can be no privacy about that, anyhow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't suppose  any paper will want to report it, for Waldron has been reported already  a dozen times, and no one is aware that Challenger will speak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We may  get a scoop, if we are lucky.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You'll be there in any case, so you'll  just give us a pretty full report.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll keep space up to midnight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    My day was a busy one, and I had an early dinner at the Savage Club  with Tarp Henry, to whom I gave some account of my adventures.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He  listened with a sceptical smile on his gaunt face, and roared with  laughter on hearing that the Professor had convinced me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"My dear chap, things don't happen like that in real life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>People  don't stumble upon enormous discoveries and then lose their evidence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Leave that to the novelists.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The fellow is as full of tricks as the  monkey-house at the Zoo.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's all bosh.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But the American poet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "He never existed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I saw his sketch-book.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Challenger's sketch-book.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You think he drew that animal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Of course he did.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Who else.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, then, the photographs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "There was nothing in the photographs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By your own admission you only  saw a bird.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A pterodactyl.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "That's what HE says.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He put the pterodactyl into your head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, then, the bones.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "First one out of an Irish stew.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Second one vamped up for the  occasion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If you are clever and know your business you can fake a bone  as easily as you can a photograph.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I began to feel uneasy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps, after all, I had been premature in my  acquiescence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then I had a sudden happy thought.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Will you come to the meeting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Tarp Henry looked thoughtful.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"He is not a popular person, the genial Challenger," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"A lot  of people have accounts to settle with him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I should say he is about  the best-hated man in London.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If the medical students turn out there  will be no end of a rag.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't want to get into a bear-garden.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You might at least do him the justice to hear him state his own case.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, perhaps it's only fair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm your man for the  evening.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    When we arrived at the hall we found a much greater concourse than I  had expected.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A line of electric broughams discharged their little  cargoes of white-bearded professors, while the dark stream of humbler  pedestrians, who crowded through the arched door-way, showed that the  audience would be popular as well as scientific.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Indeed, it became  evident to us as soon as we had taken our seats that a youthful and  even boyish spirit was abroad in the gallery and the back portions of  the hall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Looking behind me, I could see rows of faces of the familiar  medical student type.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Apparently the great hospitals had each sent  down their contingent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The behavior of the audience at present was  good-humored, but mischievous.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Scraps of popular songs were chorused  with an enthusiasm which was a strange prelude to a scientific lecture,  and there was already a tendency to personal chaff which promised a  jovial evening to others, however embarrassing it might be to the  recipients of these dubious honors.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Thus, when old Doctor Meldrum, with his well-known curly-brimmed  opera-hat, appeared upon the platform, there was such a universal query  of "Where DID you get that tile.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" that he hurriedly removed it, and  concealed it furtively under his chair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When gouty Professor Wadley  limped down to his seat there were general affectionate inquiries from  all parts of the hall as to the exact state of his poor toe, which  caused him obvious embarrassment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The greatest demonstration of all,  however, was at the entrance of my new acquaintance, Professor  Challenger, when he passed down to take his place at the extreme end of  the front row of the platform.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such a yell of welcome broke forth when  his black beard first protruded round the corner that I began to  suspect Tarp Henry was right in his surmise, and that this assemblage  was there not merely for the sake of the lecture, but because it had  got rumored abroad that the famous Professor would take part in the  proceedings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was some sympathetic laughter on his entrance among the front  benches of well-dressed spectators, as though the demonstration of the  students in this instance was not unwelcome to them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That greeting  was, indeed, a frightful outburst of sound, the uproar of the carnivora  cage when the step of the bucket-bearing keeper is heard in the  distance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was an offensive tone in it, perhaps, and yet in the  main it struck me as mere riotous outcry, the noisy reception of one  who amused and interested them, rather than of one they disliked or  despised.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger smiled with weary and tolerant contempt, as a  kindly man would meet the yapping of a litter of puppies.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He sat  slowly down, blew out his chest, passed his hand caressingly down his  beard, and looked with drooping eyelids and supercilious eyes at the  crowded hall before him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The uproar of his advent had not yet died  away when Professor Ronald Murray, the chairman, and Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron, the  lecturer, threaded their way to the front, and the proceedings began.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Murray will, I am sure, excuse me if I say that he has the  common fault of most Englishmen of being inaudible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why on earth  people who have something to say which is worth hearing should not take  the slight trouble to learn how to make it heard is one of the strange  mysteries of modern life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their methods are as reasonable as to try to  pour some precious stuff from the spring to the reservoir through a  non-conducting pipe, which could by the least effort be opened.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Murray made several profound remarks to his white tie and to  the water-carafe upon the table, with a humorous, twinkling aside to  the silver candlestick upon his right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then he sat down, and Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron, the famous popular lecturer, rose amid a general murmur of  applause.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was a stern, gaunt man, with a harsh voice, and an  aggressive manner, but he had the merit of knowing how to assimilate  the ideas of other men, and to pass them on in a way which was  intelligible and even interesting to the lay public, with a happy knack  of being funny about the most unlikely objects, so that the precession  of the Equinox or the formation of a vertebrate became a highly  humorous process as treated by him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a bird's-eye view of creation, as interpreted by science, which,  in language always clear and sometimes picturesque, he unfolded before  us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He told us of the globe, a huge mass of flaming gas, flaring  through the heavens.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then he pictured the solidification, the cooling,  the wrinkling which formed the mountains, the steam which turned to  water, the slow preparation of the stage upon which was to be played  the inexplicable drama of life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the origin of life itself he was  discreetly vague.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That the germs of it could hardly have survived the  original roasting was, he declared, fairly certain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Therefore it had  come later.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Had it built itself out of the cooling, inorganic elements  of the globe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Very likely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Had the germs of it arrived from outside  upon a meteor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was hardly conceivable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the whole, the wisest  man was the least dogmatic upon the point.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We could not--or at least  we had not succeeded up to date in making organic life in our  laboratories out of inorganic materials.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The gulf between the dead and  the living was something which our chemistry could not as yet bridge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But there was a higher and subtler chemistry of Nature, which, working  with great forces over long epochs, might well produce results which  were impossible for us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There the matter must be left.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This brought the lecturer to the great ladder of animal life, beginning  low down in molluscs and feeble sea creatures, then up rung by rung  through reptiles and fishes, till at last we came to a kangaroo-rat, a  creature which brought forth its young alive, the direct ancestor of  all mammals, and presumably, therefore, of everyone in the audience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>("No, no," from a sceptical student in the back row.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  If the young  gentleman in the red tie who cried "No, no," and who presumably claimed  to have been hatched out of an egg, would wait upon him after the  lecture, he would be glad to see such a curiosity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>(Laughter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  It was  strange to think that the climax of all the age-long process of Nature  had been the creation of that gentleman in the red tie.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But had the  process stopped.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Was this gentleman to be taken as the final type--the  be-all and end-all of development.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He hoped that he would not hurt the  feelings of the gentleman in the red tie if he maintained that,  whatever virtues that gentleman might possess in private life, still  the vast processes of the universe were not fully justified if they  were to end entirely in his production.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Evolution was not a spent  force, but one still working, and even greater achievements were in  store.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Having thus, amid a general titter, played very prettily with his  interrupter, the lecturer went back to his picture of the past, the  drying of the seas, the emergence of the sand-bank, the sluggish,  viscous life which lay upon their margins, the overcrowded lagoons, the  tendency of the sea creatures to take refuge upon the mud-flats, the  abundance of food awaiting them, their consequent enormous growth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Hence, ladies and gentlemen," he added, "that frightful brood of  saurians which still affright our eyes when seen in the Wealden or in  the Solenhofen slates, but which were fortunately extinct long before  the first appearance of mankind upon this planet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Question.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" boomed a voice from the platform.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron was a strict disciplinarian with a gift of acid humor, as  exemplified upon the gentleman with the red tie, which made it perilous  to interrupt him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But this interjection appeared to him so absurd that  he was at a loss how to deal with it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So looks the Shakespearean who  is confronted by a rancid Baconian, or the astronomer who is assailed  by a flat-earth fanatic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He paused for a moment, and then, raising his  voice, repeated slowly the words:  "Which were extinct before the  coming of man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Question.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" boomed the voice once more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron looked with amazement along the line of professors upon the  platform until his eyes fell upon the figure of Challenger, who leaned  back in his chair with closed eyes and an amused expression, as if he  were smiling in his sleep.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I see.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said Waldron, with a shrug.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is my friend Professor  Challenger," and amid laughter he renewed his lecture as if this was a  final explanation and no more need be said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But the incident was far from being closed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Whatever path the lecturer  took amid the wilds of the past seemed invariably to lead him to some  assertion as to extinct or prehistoric life which instantly brought the  same bulls' bellow from the Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The audience began to  anticipate it and to roar with delight when it came.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The packed  benches of students joined in, and every time Challenger's beard  opened, before any sound could come forth, there was a yell of  "Question.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" from a hundred voices, and an answering counter cry of  "Order.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" and "Shame.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" from as many more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron, though a hardened  lecturer and a strong man, became rattled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He hesitated, stammered,  repeated himself, got snarled in a long sentence, and finally turned  furiously upon the cause of his troubles.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"This is really intolerable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried, glaring across the platform.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I must ask you, Professor Challenger, to cease these ignorant and  unmannerly interruptions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    There was a hush over the hall, the students rigid with delight at  seeing the high gods on Olympus quarrelling among themselves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger levered his bulky figure slowly out of his chair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I must in turn ask you, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron," he said, "to cease to make  assertions which are not in strict accordance with scientific fact.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The words unloosed a tempest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Shame.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Shame.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  "Give him a hearing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  "Put him out.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  "Shove him off the platform.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  "Fair play.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" emerged  from a general roar of amusement or execration.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The chairman was on  his feet flapping both his hands and bleating excitedly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Professor  Challenger--personal--views--later," were the solid peaks above his  clouds of inaudible mutter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The interrupter bowed, smiled, stroked his  beard, and relapsed into his chair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron, very flushed and warlike,  continued his observations.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now and then, as he made an assertion, he  shot a venomous glance at his opponent, who seemed to be slumbering  deeply, with the same broad, happy smile upon his face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last the lecture came to an end--I am inclined to think that it was  a premature one, as the peroration was hurried and disconnected.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  thread of the argument had been rudely broken, and the audience was  restless and expectant.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron sat down, and, after a chirrup from  the chairman, Professor Challenger rose and advanced to the edge of the  platform.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the interests of my paper I took down his speech verbatim.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Ladies and Gentlemen," he began, amid a sustained interruption from  the back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I beg pardon--Ladies, Gentlemen, and Children--I must  apologize, I had inadvertently omitted a considerable section of this  audience" (tumult, during which the Professor stood with one hand  raised and his enormous head nodding sympathetically, as if he were  bestowing a pontifical blessing upon the crowd), "I have been selected  to move a vote of thanks to Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron for the very picturesque and  imaginative address to which we have just listened.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are points  in it with which I disagree, and it has been my duty to indicate them  as they arose, but, none the less, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron has accomplished his  object well, that object being to give a simple and interesting account  of what he conceives to have been the history of our planet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Popular  lectures are the easiest to listen to, but Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron" (here he beamed  and blinked at the lecturer) "will excuse me when I say that they are  necessarily both superficial and misleading, since they have to be  graded to the comprehension of an ignorant audience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (Ironical  cheering.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "Popular lecturers are in their nature parasitic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (Angry  gesture of protest from Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "They exploit for fame or cash  the work which has been done by their indigent and unknown brethren.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One smallest new fact obtained in the laboratory, one brick built into  the temple of science, far outweighs any second-hand exposition which  passes an idle hour, but can leave no useful result behind it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I put  forward this obvious reflection, not out of any desire to disparage Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron in particular, but that you may not lose your sense of  proportion and mistake the acolyte for the high priest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" (At this point  Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron whispered to the chairman, who half rose and said something  severely to his water-carafe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "But enough of this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (Loud and  prolonged cheers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "Let me pass to some subject of wider interest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What is the particular point upon which I, as an original investigator,  have challenged our lecturer's accuracy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is upon the permanence of  certain types of animal life upon the earth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I do not speak upon this  subject as an amateur, nor, I may add, as a popular lecturer, but I  speak as one whose scientific conscience compels him to adhere closely  to facts, when I say that Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Waldron is very wrong in supposing that  because he has never himself seen a so-called prehistoric animal,  therefore these creatures no longer exist.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They are indeed, as he has  said, our ancestors, but they are, if I may use the expression, our  contemporary ancestors, who can still be found with all their hideous  and formidable characteristics if one has but the energy and hardihood  to seek their haunts.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Creatures which were supposed to be Jurassic,  monsters who would hunt down and devour our largest and fiercest  mammals, still exist.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" (Cries of "Bosh.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" "Prove it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" "How do YOU know.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  "Question.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>") "How do I know, you ask me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I know because I have visited  their secret haunts.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I know because I have seen some of them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (Applause, uproar, and a voice, "Liar.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>")  "Am I a liar.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" (General  hearty and noisy assent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "Did I hear someone say that I was a liar.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Will the person who called me a liar kindly stand up that I may know  him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (A voice, "Here he is, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" and an inoffensive little person in  spectacles, struggling violently, was held up among a group of  students.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "Did you venture to call me a liar.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  ("No, sir, no.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  shouted the accused, and disappeared like a jack-in-the-box.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "If any  person in this hall dares to doubt my veracity, I shall be glad to have  a few words with him after the lecture.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  ("Liar.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>")  "Who said that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (Again the inoffensive one plunging desperately, was elevated high into  the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>) "If I come down among you----" (General chorus of "Come,  love, come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" which interrupted the proceedings for some moments, while  the chairman, standing up and waving both his arms, seemed to be  conducting the music.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Professor, with his face flushed, his  nostrils dilated, and his beard bristling, was now in a proper Berserk  mood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "Every great discoverer has been met with the same  incredulity--the sure brand of a generation of fools.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When great facts  are laid before you, you have not the intuition, the imagination which  would help you to understand them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You can only throw mud at the men  who have risked their lives to open new fields to science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You  persecute the prophets.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Galileo.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Darwin, and I----" (Prolonged  cheering and complete interruption.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)    All this is from my hurried notes taken at the time, which give little  notion of the absolute chaos to which the assembly had by this time  been reduced.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So terrific was the uproar that several ladies had  already beaten a hurried retreat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Grave and reverend seniors seemed to  have caught the prevailing spirit as badly as the students, and I saw  white-bearded men rising and shaking their fists at the obdurate  Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The whole great audience seethed and simmered like a  boiling pot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Professor took a step forward and raised both his  hands.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was something so big and arresting and virile in the man  that the clatter and shouting died gradually away before his commanding  gesture and his masterful eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He seemed to have a definite message.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They hushed to hear it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I will not detain you," he said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is not worth it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Truth is  truth, and the noise of a number of foolish young men--and, I fear I  must add, of their equally foolish seniors--cannot affect the matter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I claim that I have opened a new field of science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You dispute it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (Cheers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "Then I put you to the test.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Will you accredit one or more  of your own number to go out as your representatives and test my  statement in your name.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee, the veteran Professor of Comparative Anatomy, rose among  the audience, a tall, thin, bitter man, with the withered aspect of a  theologian.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He wished, he said, to ask Professor Challenger whether  the results to which he had alluded in his remarks had been obtained  during a journey to the headwaters of the Amazon made by him two years  before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger answered that they had.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee desired to know how it was that Professor Challenger  claimed to have made discoveries in those regions which had been  overlooked by Wallace, Bates, and other previous explorers of  established scientific repute.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger answered that Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee appeared to be  confusing the Amazon with the Thames; that it was in reality a somewhat  larger river; that Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee might be interested to know that with  the Orinoco, which communicated with it, some fifty thousand miles of  country were opened up, and that in so vast a space it was not  impossible for one person to find what another had missed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee declared, with an acid smile, that he fully appreciated  the difference between the Thames and the Amazon, which lay in the fact  that any assertion about the former could be tested, while about the  latter it could not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He would be obliged if Professor Challenger would  give the latitude and the longitude of the country in which prehistoric  animals were to be found.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger replied that he reserved such information for good  reasons of his own, but would be prepared to give it with proper  precautions to a committee chosen from the audience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Would Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee serve on such a committee and test his story in person.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee:  "Yes, I will.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (Great cheering.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)    Professor Challenger:  "Then I guarantee that I will place in your  hands such material as will enable you to find your way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is only  right, however, since Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee goes to check my statement that I  should have one or more with him who may check his.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I will not  disguise from you that there are difficulties and dangers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee will need a younger colleague.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>May I ask for volunteers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It is thus that the great crisis of a man's life springs out at him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Could I have imagined when I entered that hall that I was about to  pledge myself to a wilder adventure than had ever come to me in my  dreams.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But Gladys--was it not the very opportunity of which she  spoke.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Gladys would have told me to go.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had sprung to my feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  was speaking, and yet I had prepared no words.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Tarp Henry, my  companion, was plucking at my skirts and I heard him whispering, "Sit  down, Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't make a public ass of yourself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  At the same time I  was aware that a tall, thin man, with dark gingery hair, a few seats in  front of me, was also upon his feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He glared back at me with hard  angry eyes, but I refused to give way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I will go, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Chairman," I kept repeating over and over again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Name.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Name.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried the audience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"My name is Edward Dunn Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am the reporter of the Daily  Gazette.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I claim to be an absolutely unprejudiced witness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What is YOUR name, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" the chairman asked of my tall rival.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am Lord John Roxton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have already been up the Amazon, I know all  the ground, and have special qualifications for this investigation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Lord John Roxton's reputation as a sportsman and a traveler is, of  course, world-famous," said the chairman; "at the same time it would  certainly be as well to have a member of the Press upon such an  expedition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then I move," said Professor Challenger, "that both these gentlemen be  elected, as representatives of this meeting, to accompany Professor  Summerlee upon his journey to investigate and to report upon the truth  of my statements.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    And so, amid shouting and cheering, our fate was decided, and I found  myself borne away in the human current which swirled towards the door,  with my mind half stunned by the vast new project which had risen so  suddenly before it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I emerged from the hall I was conscious for a  moment of a rush of laughing students--down the pavement, and of an arm  wielding a heavy umbrella, which rose and fell in the midst of them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, amid a mixture of groans and cheers, Professor Challenger's  electric brougham slid from the curb, and I found myself walking under  the silvery lights of Regent Street, full of thoughts of Gladys and of  wonder as to my future.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly there was a touch at my elbow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I turned, and found myself  looking into the humorous, masterful eyes of the tall, thin man who had  volunteered to be my companion on this strange quest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, I understand," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We are to be companions--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My rooms are just over the road, in the Albany.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps you would have  the kindness to spare me half an hour, for there are one or two things  that I badly want to say to you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"                                      CHAPTER VI                      "I was the Flail of the Lord"    Lord John Roxton and I turned down Vigo Street together and through the  dingy portals of the famous aristocratic rookery.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At the end of a long  drab passage my new acquaintance pushed open a door and turned on an  electric switch.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A number of lamps shining through tinted shades  bathed the whole great room before us in a ruddy radiance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Standing in  the doorway and glancing round me, I had a general impression of  extraordinary comfort and elegance combined with an atmosphere of  masculine virility.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Everywhere there were mingled the luxury of the  wealthy man of taste and the careless untidiness of the bachelor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Rich  furs and strange iridescent mats from some Oriental bazaar were  scattered upon the floor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Pictures and prints which even my  unpractised eyes could recognize as being of great price and rarity  hung thick upon the walls.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sketches of boxers, of ballet-girls, and of  racehorses alternated with a sensuous Fragonard, a martial Girardet,  and a dreamy Turner.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But amid these varied ornaments there were  scattered the trophies which brought back strongly to my recollection  the fact that Lord John Roxton was one of the great all-round sportsmen  and athletes of his day.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A dark-blue oar crossed with a cherry-pink  one above his mantel-piece spoke of the old Oxonian and Leander man,  while the foils and boxing-gloves above and below them were the tools  of a man who had won supremacy with each.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Like a dado round the room  was the jutting line of splendid heavy game-heads, the best of their  sort from every quarter of the world, with the rare white rhinoceros of  the Lado Enclave drooping its supercilious lip above them all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the center of the rich red carpet was a black and gold Louis Quinze  table, a lovely antique, now sacrilegiously desecrated with marks of  glasses and the scars of cigar-stumps.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On it stood a silver tray of  smokables and a burnished spirit-stand, from which and an adjacent  siphon my silent host proceeded to charge two high glasses.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Having  indicated an arm-chair to me and placed my refreshment near it, he  handed me a long, smooth Havana.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, seating himself opposite to me,  he looked at me long and fixedly with his strange, twinkling, reckless  eyes--eyes of a cold light blue, the color of a glacier lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Through the thin haze of my cigar-smoke I noted the details of a face  which was already familiar to me from many photographs--the  strongly-curved nose, the hollow, worn cheeks, the dark, ruddy hair,  thin at the top, the crisp, virile moustaches, the small, aggressive  tuft upon his projecting chin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Something there was of Napoleon III.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>,  something of Don Quixote, and yet again something which was the essence  of the English country gentleman, the keen, alert, open-air lover of  dogs and of horses.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His skin was of a rich flower-pot red from sun and  wind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His eyebrows were tufted and overhanging, which gave those  naturally cold eyes an almost ferocious aspect, an impression which was  increased by his strong and furrowed brow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In figure he was spare, but  very strongly built--indeed, he had often proved that there were few  men in England capable of such sustained exertions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His height was a  little over six feet, but he seemed shorter on account of a peculiar  rounding of the shoulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such was the famous Lord John Roxton as he  sat opposite to me, biting hard upon his cigar and watching me steadily  in a long and embarrassing silence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well," said he, at last, "we've gone and done it, young fellah my  lad.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (This curious phrase he pronounced as if it were all one  word--"young-fellah-me-lad.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>")  "Yes, we've taken a jump, you an' me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  suppose, now, when you went into that room there was no such notion in  your head--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No thought of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "The same here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No thought of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And here we are, up to our necks in  the tureen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why, I've only been back three weeks from Uganda, and  taken a place in Scotland, and signed the lease and all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Pretty goin's  on--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How does it hit you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, it is all in the main line of my business.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am a journalist on  the Gazette.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Of course--you said so when you took it on.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By the way, I've got a  small job for you, if you'll help me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "With pleasure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Don't mind takin' a risk, do you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What is the risk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, it's Ballinger--he's the risk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You've heard of him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Why, young fellah, where HAVE you lived.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sir John Ballinger is the  best gentleman jock in the north country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could hold him on the flat  at my best, but over jumps he's my master.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, it's an open secret  that when he's out of trainin' he drinks hard--strikin' an average, he  calls it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He got delirium on Toosday, and has been ragin' like a devil  ever since.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His room is above this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The doctors say that it is all up  with the old dear unless some food is got into him, but as he lies in  bed with a revolver on his coverlet, and swears he will put six of the  best through anyone that comes near him, there's been a bit of a strike  among the serving-men.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He's a hard nail, is Jack, and a dead shot,  too, but you can't leave a Grand National winner to die like  that--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What do you mean to do, then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, my idea was that you and I could rush him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He may be dozin',  and at the worst he can only wing one of us, and the other should have  him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If we can get his bolster-cover round his arms and then 'phone up  a stomach-pump, we'll give the old dear the supper of his life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was a rather desperate business to come suddenly into one's day's  work.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't think that I am a particularly brave man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have an  Irish imagination which makes the unknown and the untried more terrible  than they are.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the other hand, I was brought up with a horror of  cowardice and with a terror of such a stigma.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I dare say that I could  throw myself over a precipice, like the Hun in the history books, if my  courage to do it were questioned, and yet it would surely be pride and  fear, rather than courage, which would be my inspiration.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Therefore,  although every nerve in my body shrank from the whisky-maddened figure  which I pictured in the room above, I still answered, in as careless a  voice as I could command, that I was ready to go.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some further remark  of Lord Roxton's about the danger only made me irritable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Talking won't make it any better," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Come on.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I rose from my chair and he from his.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then with a little confidential  chuckle of laughter, he patted me two or three times on the chest,  finally pushing me back into my chair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"All right, sonny my lad--you'll do," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I looked up in surprise.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I saw after Jack Ballinger myself this mornin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He blew a hole in the  skirt of my kimono, bless his shaky old hand, but we got a jacket on  him, and he's to be all right in a week.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I say, young fellah, I hope  you don't mind--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You see, between you an' me close-tiled, I look  on this South American business as a mighty serious thing, and if I  have a pal with me I want a man I can bank on.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So I sized you down,  and I'm bound to say that you came well out of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You see, it's all  up to you and me, for this old Summerlee man will want dry-nursin' from  the first.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By the way, are you by any chance the Malone who is  expected to get his Rugby cap for Ireland.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A reserve, perhaps.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I thought I remembered your face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why, I was there when you got that  try against Richmond--as fine a swervin' run as I saw the whole season.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I never miss a Rugby match if I can help it, for it is the manliest  game we have left.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, I didn't ask you in here just to talk sport.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We've got to fix our business.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here are the sailin's, on the first  page of the Times.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There's a Booth boat for Para next Wednesday week,  and if the Professor and you can work it, I think we should take  it--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Very good, I'll fix it with him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What about your outfit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "My paper will see to that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Can you shoot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "About average Territorial standard.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Good Lord.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>as bad as that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's the last thing you young fellahs  think of learnin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You're all bees without stings, so far as lookin'  after the hive goes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You'll look silly, some o' these days, when  someone comes along an' sneaks the honey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But you'll need to hold your  gun straight in South America, for, unless our friend the Professor is  a madman or a liar, we may see some queer things before we get back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What gun have you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He crossed to an oaken cupboard, and as he threw it open I caught a  glimpse of glistening rows of parallel barrels, like the pipes of an  organ.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I'll see what I can spare you out of my own battery," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One by one he took out a succession of beautiful rifles, opening and  shutting them with a snap and a clang, and then patting them as he put  them back into the rack as tenderly as a mother would fondle her  children.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"This is a Bland's.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>577 axite express," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I got that big  fellow with it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He glanced up at the white rhinoceros.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Ten more  yards, and he'd would have added me to HIS collection.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'On that conical bullet his one chance hangs,           'Tis the weak one's advantage fair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'    Hope you know your Gordon, for he's the poet of the horse and the gun  and the man that handles both.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, here's a useful tool--.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>470,  telescopic sight, double ejector, point-blank up to three-fifty.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's the rifle I used against the Peruvian slave-drivers three years  ago.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was the flail of the Lord up in those parts, I may tell you,  though you won't find it in any Blue-book.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are times, young  fellah, when every one of us must make a stand for human right and  justice, or you never feel clean again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's why I made a little war  on my own.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Declared it myself, waged it myself, ended it myself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Each  of those nicks is for a slave murderer--a good row of them--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That  big one is for Pedro Lopez, the king of them all, that I killed in a  backwater of the Putomayo River.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, here's something that would do  for you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He took out a beautiful brown-and-silver rifle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well  rubbered at the stock, sharply sighted, five cartridges to the clip.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You can trust your life to that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He handed it to me and closed the  door of his oak cabinet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"By the way," he continued, coming back to his chair, "what do you know  of this Professor Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I never saw him till to-day.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, neither did I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's funny we should both sail under sealed  orders from a man we don't know.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He seemed an uppish old bird.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His  brothers of science don't seem too fond of him, either.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How came you  to take an interest in the affair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I told him shortly my experiences of the morning, and he listened  intently.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then he drew out a map of South America and laid it on the  table.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I believe every single word he said to you was the truth," said he,  earnestly, "and, mind you, I have something to go on when I speak like  that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>South America is a place I love, and I think, if you take it  right through from Darien to Fuego, it's the grandest, richest, most  wonderful bit of earth upon this planet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>People don't know it yet, and  don't realize what it may become.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I've been up an' down it from end to  end, and had two dry seasons in those very parts, as I told you when I  spoke of the war I made on the slave-dealers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, when I was up  there I heard some yarns of the same kind--traditions of Indians and  the like, but with somethin' behind them, no doubt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The more you knew  of that country, young fellah, the more you would understand that  anythin' was possible--ANYTHIN'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are just some narrow  water-lanes along which folk travel, and outside that it is all  darkness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, down here in the Matto Grande"--he swept his cigar over  a part of the map--"or up in this corner where three countries meet,  nothin' would surprise me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As that chap said to-night, there are  fifty-thousand miles of water-way runnin' through a forest that is very  near the size of Europe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You and I could be as far away from each  other as Scotland is from Constantinople, and yet each of us be in the  same great Brazilian forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Man has just made a track here and a  scrape there in the maze.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why, the river rises and falls the best part  of forty feet, and half the country is a morass that you can't pass  over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why shouldn't somethin' new and wonderful lie in such a country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And why shouldn't we be the men to find it out.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Besides," he added,  his queer, gaunt face shining with delight, "there's a sportin' risk in  every mile of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm like an old golf-ball--I've had all the white  paint knocked off me long ago.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Life can whack me about now, and it  can't leave a mark.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But a sportin' risk, young fellah, that's the salt  of existence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then it's worth livin' again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We're all gettin' a deal  too soft and dull and comfy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Give me the great waste lands and the  wide spaces, with a gun in my fist and somethin' to look for that's  worth findin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I've tried war and steeplechasin' and aeroplanes, but  this huntin' of beasts that look like a lobster-supper dream is a  brand-new sensation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He chuckled with glee at the prospect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps I have dwelt too long upon this new acquaintance, but he is to  be my comrade for many a day, and so I have tried to set him down as I  first saw him, with his quaint personality and his queer little tricks  of speech and of thought.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was only the need of getting in the  account of my meeting which drew me at last from his company.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I left  him seated amid his pink radiance, oiling the lock of his favorite  rifle, while he still chuckled to himself at the thought of the  adventures which awaited us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was very clear to me that if dangers  lay before us I could not in all England have found a cooler head or a  braver spirit with which to share them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That night, wearied as I was after the wonderful happenings of the day,  I sat late with McArdle, the news editor, explaining to him the whole  situation, which he thought important enough to bring next morning  before the notice of Sir George Beaumont, the chief.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was agreed  that I should write home full accounts of my adventures in the shape of  successive letters to McArdle, and that these should either be edited  for the Gazette as they arrived, or held back to be published later,  according to the wishes of Professor Challenger, since we could not yet  know what conditions he might attach to those directions which should  guide us to the unknown land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In response to a telephone inquiry, we  received nothing more definite than a fulmination against the Press,  ending up with the remark that if we would notify our boat he would  hand us any directions which he might think it proper to give us at the  moment of starting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A second question from us failed to elicit any  answer at all, save a plaintive bleat from his wife to the effect that  her husband was in a very violent temper already, and that she hoped we  would do nothing to make it worse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A third attempt, later in the day,  provoked a terrific crash, and a subsequent message from the Central  Exchange that Professor Challenger's receiver had been shattered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After that we abandoned all attempt at communication.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And now my patient readers, I can address you directly no longer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From  now onwards (if, indeed, any continuation of this narrative should ever  reach you) it can only be through the paper which I represent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the  hands of the editor I leave this account of the events which have led  up to one of the most remarkable expeditions of all time, so that if I  never return to England there shall be some record as to how the affair  came about.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am writing these last lines in the saloon of the Booth  liner Francisca, and they will go back by the pilot to the keeping of  Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>McArdle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let me draw one last picture before I close the  notebook--a picture which is the last memory of the old country which I  bear away with me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is a wet, foggy morning in the late spring; a  thin, cold rain is falling.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Three shining mackintoshed figures are  walking down the quay, making for the gang-plank of the great liner  from which the blue-peter is flying.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In front of them a porter pushes  a trolley piled high with trunks, wraps, and gun-cases.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor  Summerlee, a long, melancholy figure, walks with dragging steps and  drooping head, as one who is already profoundly sorry for himself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John Roxton steps briskly, and his thin, eager face beams forth  between his hunting-cap and his muffler.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As for myself, I am glad to  have got the bustling days of preparation and the pangs of leave-taking  behind me, and I have no doubt that I show it in my bearing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly,  just as we reach the vessel, there is a shout behind us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is  Professor Challenger, who had promised to see us off.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He runs after  us, a puffing, red-faced, irascible figure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No thank you," says he; "I should much prefer not to go aboard.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  have only a few words to say to you, and they can very well be said  where we are.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I beg you not to imagine that I am in any way indebted  to you for making this journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I would have you to understand that it  is a matter of perfect indifference to me, and I refuse to entertain  the most remote sense of personal obligation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Truth is truth, and  nothing which you can report can affect it in any way, though it may  excite the emotions and allay the curiosity of a number of very  ineffectual people.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My directions for your instruction and guidance  are in this sealed envelope.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You will open it when you reach a town  upon the Amazon which is called Manaos, but not until the date and hour  which is marked upon the outside.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Have I made myself clear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I leave  the strict observance of my conditions entirely to your honor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, I will place no restriction upon your correspondence, since the  ventilation of the facts is the object of your journey; but I demand  that you shall give no particulars as to your exact destination, and  that nothing be actually published until your return.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Good-bye, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You have done something to mitigate my feelings for the loathsome  profession to which you unhappily belong.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Good-bye, Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Science is, as I understand, a sealed book to you; but you may  congratulate yourself upon the hunting-field which awaits you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You  will, no doubt, have the opportunity of describing in the Field how you  brought down the rocketing dimorphodon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And good-bye to you also,  Professor Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If you are still capable of self-improvement, of  which I am frankly unconvinced, you will surely return to London a  wiser man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    So he turned upon his heel, and a minute later from the deck I could  see his short, squat figure bobbing about in the distance as he made  his way back to his train.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, we are well down Channel now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There's the last bell for letters, and it's good-bye to the pilot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We'll be "down, hull-down, on the old trail" from now on.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>God bless  all we leave behind us, and send us safely back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER VII                "To-morrow we Disappear into the Unknown"    I will not bore those whom this narrative may reach by an account of  our luxurious voyage upon the Booth liner, nor will I tell of our  week's stay at Para (save that I should wish to acknowledge the great  kindness of the Pereira da Pinta Company in helping us to get together  our equipment).
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I will also allude very briefly to our river journey,  up a wide, slow-moving, clay-tinted stream, in a steamer which was  little smaller than that which had carried us across the Atlantic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Eventually we found ourselves through the narrows of Obidos and reached  the town of Manaos.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here we were rescued from the limited attractions  of the local inn by Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Shortman, the representative of the British and  Brazilian Trading Company.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In his hospital Fazenda we spent our time  until the day when we were empowered to open the letter of instructions  given to us by Professor Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Before I reach the surprising  events of that date I would desire to give a clearer sketch of my  comrades in this enterprise, and of the associates whom we had already  gathered together in South America.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I speak freely, and I leave the  use of my material to your own discretion, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>McArdle, since it is  through your hands that this report must pass before it reaches the  world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The scientific attainments of Professor Summerlee are too well known  for me to trouble to recapitulate them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He is better equipped for a  rough expedition of this sort than one would imagine at first sight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His tall, gaunt, stringy figure is insensible to fatigue, and his dry,  half-sarcastic, and often wholly unsympathetic manner is uninfluenced  by any change in his surroundings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Though in his sixty-sixth year, I  have never heard him express any dissatisfaction at the occasional  hardships which we have had to encounter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had regarded his presence  as an encumbrance to the expedition, but, as a matter of fact, I am now  well convinced that his power of endurance is as great as my own.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In  temper he is naturally acid and sceptical.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From the beginning he has  never concealed his belief that Professor Challenger is an absolute  fraud, that we are all embarked upon an absurd wild-goose chase and  that we are likely to reap nothing but disappointment and danger in  South America, and corresponding ridicule in England.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such are the  views which, with much passionate distortion of his thin features and  wagging of his thin, goat-like beard, he poured into our ears all the  way from Southampton to Manaos.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Since landing from the boat he has  obtained some consolation from the beauty and variety of the insect and  bird life around him, for he is absolutely whole-hearted in his  devotion to science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He spends his days flitting through the woods  with his shot-gun and his butterfly-net, and his evenings in mounting  the many specimens he has acquired.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Among his minor peculiarities are  that he is careless as to his attire, unclean in his person,  exceedingly absent-minded in his habits, and addicted to smoking a  short briar pipe, which is seldom out of his mouth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He has been upon  several scientific expeditions in his youth (he was with Robertson in  Papua), and the life of the camp and the canoe is nothing fresh to him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John Roxton has some points in common with Professor Summerlee,  and others in which they are the very antithesis to each other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He is  twenty years younger, but has something of the same spare, scraggy  physique.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to his appearance, I have, as I recollect, described it  in that portion of my narrative which I have left behind me in London.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He is exceedingly neat and prim in his ways, dresses always with great  care in white drill suits and high brown mosquito-boots, and shaves at  least once a day.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Like most men of action, he is laconic in speech,  and sinks readily into his own thoughts, but he is always quick to  answer a question or join in a conversation, talking in a queer, jerky,  half-humorous fashion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His knowledge of the world, and very especially  of South America, is surprising, and he has a whole-hearted belief in  the possibilities of our journey which is not to be dashed by the  sneers of Professor Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He has a gentle voice and a quiet  manner, but behind his twinkling blue eyes there lurks a capacity for  furious wrath and implacable resolution, the more dangerous because  they are held in leash.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He spoke little of his own exploits in Brazil  and Peru, but it was a revelation to me to find the excitement which  was caused by his presence among the riverine natives, who looked upon  him as their champion and protector.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The exploits of the Red Chief, as  they called him, had become legends among them, but the real facts, as  far as I could learn them, were amazing enough.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These were that Lord John had found himself some years before in that  no-man's-land which is formed by the half-defined frontiers between  Peru, Brazil, and Columbia.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In this great district the wild rubber  tree flourishes, and has become, as in the Congo, a curse to the  natives which can only be compared to their forced labor under the  Spaniards upon the old silver mines of Darien.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A handful of villainous  half-breeds dominated the country, armed such Indians as would support  them, and turned the rest into slaves, terrorizing them with the most  inhuman tortures in order to force them to gather the india-rubber,  which was then floated down the river to Para.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John Roxton  expostulated on behalf of the wretched victims, and received nothing  but threats and insults for his pains.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He then formally declared war  against Pedro Lopez, the leader of the slave-drivers, enrolled a band  of runaway slaves in his service, armed them, and conducted a campaign,  which ended by his killing with his own hands the notorious half-breed  and breaking down the system which he represented.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No wonder that the ginger-headed man with the silky voice and the free  and easy manners was now looked upon with deep interest upon the banks  of the great South American river, though the feelings he inspired were  naturally mixed, since the gratitude of the natives was equaled by the  resentment of those who desired to exploit them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One useful result of  his former experiences was that he could talk fluently in the Lingoa  Geral, which is the peculiar talk, one-third Portuguese and two-thirds  Indian, which is current all over Brazil.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have said before that Lord John Roxton was a South Americomaniac.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He  could not speak of that great country without ardor, and this ardor was  infectious, for, ignorant as I was, he fixed my attention and  stimulated my curiosity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How I wish I could reproduce the glamour of  his discourses, the peculiar mixture of accurate knowledge and of racy  imagination which gave them their fascination, until even the  Professor's cynical and sceptical smile would gradually vanish from his  thin face as he listened.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He would tell the history of the mighty  river so rapidly explored (for some of the first conquerors of Peru  actually crossed the entire continent upon its waters), and yet so  unknown in regard to all that lay behind its ever-changing banks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What is there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he would cry, pointing to the north.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Wood and marsh  and unpenetrated jungle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Who knows what it may shelter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And there to  the south.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A wilderness of swampy forest, where no white man has ever  been.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The unknown is up against us on every side.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Outside the narrow  lines of the rivers what does anyone know.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Who will say what is  possible in such a country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why should old man Challenger not be  right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  At which direct defiance the stubborn sneer would reappear  upon Professor Summerlee's face, and he would sit, shaking his sardonic  head in unsympathetic silence, behind the cloud of his briar-root pipe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So much, for the moment, for my two white companions, whose characters  and limitations will be further exposed, as surely as my own, as this  narrative proceeds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But already we have enrolled certain retainers who  may play no small part in what is to come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The first is a gigantic  negro named Zambo, who is a black Hercules, as willing as any horse,  and about as intelligent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Him we enlisted at Para, on the  recommendation of the steamship company, on whose vessels he had  learned to speak a halting English.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was at Para also that we engaged Gomez and Manuel, two half-breeds  from up the river, just come down with a cargo of redwood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were  swarthy fellows, bearded and fierce, as active and wiry as panthers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Both of them had spent their lives in those upper waters of the Amazon  which we were about to explore, and it was this recommendation which  had caused Lord John to engage them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One of them, Gomez, had the  further advantage that he could speak excellent English.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These men  were willing to act as our personal servants, to cook, to row, or to  make themselves useful in any way at a payment of fifteen dollars a  month.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Besides these, we had engaged three Mojo Indians from Bolivia,  who are the most skilful at fishing and boat work of all the river  tribes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The chief of these we called Mojo, after his tribe, and the  others are known as Jose and Fernando.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Three white men, then, two  half-breeds, one negro, and three Indians made up the personnel of the  little expedition which lay waiting for its instructions at Manaos  before starting upon its singular quest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last, after a weary week, the day had come and the hour.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I ask you  to picture the shaded sitting-room of the Fazenda St.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Ignatio, two  miles inland from the town of Manaos.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Outside lay the yellow, brassy  glare of the sunshine, with the shadows of the palm trees as black and  definite as the trees themselves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The air was calm, full of the  eternal hum of insects, a tropical chorus of many octaves, from the  deep drone of the bee to the high, keen pipe of the mosquito.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Beyond  the veranda was a small cleared garden, bounded with cactus hedges and  adorned with clumps of flowering shrubs, round which the great blue  butterflies and the tiny humming-birds fluttered and darted in  crescents of sparkling light.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Within we were seated round the cane  table, on which lay a sealed envelope.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Inscribed upon it, in the  jagged handwriting of Professor Challenger, were the words:--      "Instructions to Lord John Roxton and party.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To be opened at Manaos  upon July 15th, at 12 o'clock precisely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"      Lord John had placed his watch upon the table beside him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We have seven more minutes," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The old dear is very precise.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Professor Summerlee gave an acid smile as he picked up the envelope in  his gaunt hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What can it possibly matter whether we open it now or in seven  minutes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is all part and parcel of the same system of  quackery and nonsense, for which I regret to say that the writer is  notorious.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Oh, come, we must play the game accordin' to rules," said Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's old man Challenger's show and we are here by his good will, so it  would be rotten bad form if we didn't follow his instructions to the  letter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A pretty business it is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried the Professor, bitterly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It struck  me as preposterous in London, but I'm bound to say that it seems even  more so upon closer acquaintance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't know what is inside this  envelope, but, unless it is something pretty definite, I shall be much  tempted to take the next down-river boat and catch the Bolivia at Para.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After all, I have some more responsible work in the world than to run  about disproving the assertions of a lunatic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, Roxton, surely it  is time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Time it is," said Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You can blow the whistle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He took up  the envelope and cut it with his penknife.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From it he drew a folded  sheet of paper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This he carefully opened out and flattened on the  table.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a blank sheet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He turned it over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Again it was blank.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We looked at each other in a bewildered silence, which was broken by a  discordant burst of derisive laughter from Professor Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is an open admission," he cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What more do you want.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  fellow is a self-confessed humbug.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We have only to return home and  report him as the brazen imposter that he is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Invisible ink.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I suggested.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I don't think.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said Lord Roxton, holding the paper to the light.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No, young fellah my lad, there is no use deceiving yourself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll go  bail for it that nothing has ever been written upon this paper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "May I come in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" boomed a voice from the veranda.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The shadow of a squat figure had stolen across the patch of sunlight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That voice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That monstrous breadth of shoulder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We sprang to our feet  with a gasp of astonishment as Challenger, in a round, boyish straw-hat  with a colored ribbon--Challenger, with his hands in his jacket-pockets  and his canvas shoes daintily pointing as he walked--appeared in the  open space before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He threw back his head, and there he stood in  the golden glow with all his old Assyrian luxuriance of beard, all his  native insolence of drooping eyelids and intolerant eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I fear," said he, taking out his watch, "that I am a few minutes too  late.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I gave you this envelope I must confess that I had never  intended that you should open it, for it had been my fixed intention to  be with you before the hour.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The unfortunate delay can be apportioned  between a blundering pilot and an intrusive sandbank.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I fear that it  has given my colleague, Professor Summerlee, occasion to blaspheme.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I am bound to say, sir," said Lord John, with some sternness of voice,  "that your turning up is a considerable relief to us, for our mission  seemed to have come to a premature end.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even now I can't for the life  of me understand why you should have worked it in so extraordinary a  manner.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Instead of answering, Professor Challenger entered, shook hands with  myself and Lord John, bowed with ponderous insolence to Professor  Summerlee, and sank back into a basket-chair, which creaked and swayed  beneath his weight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Is all ready for your journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We can start to-morrow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then so you shall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You need no chart of directions now, since you  will have the inestimable advantage of my own guidance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From the first  I had determined that I would myself preside over your investigation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The most elaborate charts would, as you will readily admit, be a poor  substitute for my own intelligence and advice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to the small ruse  which I played upon you in the matter of the envelope, it is clear  that, had I told you all my intentions, I should have been forced to  resist unwelcome pressure to travel out with you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Not from me, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" exclaimed Professor Summerlee, heartily.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"So long  as there was another ship upon the Atlantic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Challenger waved him away with his great hairy hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Your common sense will, I am sure, sustain my objection and realize  that it was better that I should direct my own movements and appear  only at the exact moment when my presence was needed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That moment has  now arrived.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You are in safe hands.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You will not now fail to reach  your destination.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From henceforth I take command of this expedition,  and I must ask you to complete your preparations to-night, so that we  may be able to make an early start in the morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My time is of  value, and the same thing may be said, no doubt, in a lesser degree of  your own.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I propose, therefore, that we push on as rapidly as  possible, until I have demonstrated what you have come to see.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Lord John Roxton has chartered a large steam launch, the Esmeralda,  which was to carry us up the river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So far as climate goes, it was  immaterial what time we chose for our expedition, as the temperature  ranges from seventy-five to ninety degrees both summer and winter, with  no appreciable difference in heat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In moisture, however, it is  otherwise; from December to May is the period of the rains, and during  this time the river slowly rises until it attains a height of nearly  forty feet above its low-water mark.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It floods the banks, extends in  great lagoons over a monstrous waste of country, and forms a huge  district, called locally the Gapo, which is for the most part too  marshy for foot-travel and too shallow for boating.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>About June the  waters begin to fall, and are at their lowest at October or November.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Thus our expedition was at the time of the dry season, when the great  river and its tributaries were more or less in a normal condition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The current of the river is a slight one, the drop being not greater  than eight inches in a mile.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No stream could be more convenient for  navigation, since the prevailing wind is south-east, and sailing boats  may make a continuous progress to the Peruvian frontier, dropping down  again with the current.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In our own case the excellent engines of the  Esmeralda could disregard the sluggish flow of the stream, and we made  as rapid progress as if we were navigating a stagnant lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For three  days we steamed north-westwards up a stream which even here, a thousand  miles from its mouth, was still so enormous that from its center the  two banks were mere shadows upon the distant skyline.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the fourth  day after leaving Manaos we turned into a tributary which at its mouth  was little smaller than the main stream.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It narrowed rapidly, however,  and after two more days' steaming we reached an Indian village, where  the Professor insisted that we should land, and that the Esmeralda  should be sent back to Manaos.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We should soon come upon rapids, he  explained, which would make its further use impossible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He added  privately that we were now approaching the door of the unknown country,  and that the fewer whom we took into our confidence the better it would  be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To this end also he made each of us give our word of honor that we  would publish or say nothing which would give any exact clue as to the  whereabouts of our travels, while the servants were all solemnly sworn  to the same effect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is for this reason that I am compelled to be  vague in my narrative, and I would warn my readers that in any map or  diagram which I may give the relation of places to each other may be  correct, but the points of the compass are carefully confused, so that  in no way can it be taken as an actual guide to the country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor  Challenger's reasons for secrecy may be valid or not, but we had no  choice but to adopt them, for he was prepared to abandon the whole  expedition rather than modify the conditions upon which he would guide  us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was August 2nd when we snapped our last link with the outer world by  bidding farewell to the Esmeralda.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Since then four days have passed,  during which we have engaged two large canoes from the Indians, made of  so light a material (skins over a bamboo framework) that we should be  able to carry them round any obstacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These we have loaded with all  our effects, and have engaged two additional Indians to help us in the  navigation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I understand that they are the very two--Ataca and Ipetu  by name--who accompanied Professor Challenger upon his previous  journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They appeared to be terrified at the prospect of repeating  it, but the chief has patriarchal powers in these countries, and if the  bargain is good in his eyes the clansman has little choice in the  matter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So to-morrow we disappear into the unknown.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This account I am  transmitting down the river by canoe, and it may be our last word to  those who are interested in our fate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have, according to our  arrangement, addressed it to you, my dear Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>McArdle, and I leave it  to your discretion to delete, alter, or do what you like with it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From  the assurance of Professor Challenger's manner--and in spite of the  continued scepticism of Professor Summerlee--I have no doubt that our  leader will make good his statement, and that we are really on the eve  of some most remarkable experiences.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER VIII                 "The Outlying Pickets of the New World"    Our friends at home may well rejoice with us, for we are at our goal,  and up to a point, at least, we have shown that the statement of  Professor Challenger can be verified.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We have not, it is true,  ascended the plateau, but it lies before us, and even Professor  Summerlee is in a more chastened mood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Not that he will for an instant  admit that his rival could be right, but he is less persistent in his  incessant objections, and has sunk for the most part into an observant  silence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I must hark back, however, and continue my narrative from  where I dropped it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are sending home one of our local Indians who  is injured, and I am committing this letter to his charge, with  considerable doubts in my mind as to whether it will ever come to hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I wrote last we were about to leave the Indian village where we  had been deposited by the Esmeralda.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have to begin my report by bad  news, for the first serious personal trouble (I pass over the incessant  bickerings between the Professors) occurred this evening, and might  have had a tragic ending.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have spoken of our English-speaking  half-breed, Gomez--a fine worker and a willing fellow, but afflicted, I  fancy, with the vice of curiosity, which is common enough among such  men.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the last evening he seems to have hid himself near the hut in  which we were discussing our plans, and, being observed by our huge  negro Zambo, who is as faithful as a dog and has the hatred which all  his race bear to the half-breeds, he was dragged out and carried into  our presence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Gomez whipped out his knife, however, and but for the  huge strength of his captor, which enabled him to disarm him with one  hand, he would certainly have stabbed him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The matter has ended in  reprimands, the opponents have been compelled to shake hands, and there  is every hope that all will be well.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to the feuds of the two  learned men, they are continuous and bitter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It must be admitted that  Challenger is provocative in the last degree, but Summerlee has an acid  tongue, which makes matters worse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Last night Challenger said that he  never cared to walk on the Thames Embankment and look up the river, as  it was always sad to see one's own eventual goal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He is convinced, of  course, that he is destined for Westminster Abbey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee rejoined,  however, with a sour smile, by saying that he understood that Millbank  Prison had been pulled down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger's conceit is too colossal to  allow him to be really annoyed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He only smiled in his beard and  repeated "Really.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Really.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" in the pitying tone one would use to a  child.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Indeed, they are children both--the one wizened and  cantankerous, the other formidable and overbearing, yet each with a  brain which has put him in the front rank of his scientific age.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Brain, character, soul--only as one sees more of life does one  understand how distinct is each.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The very next day we did actually make our start upon this remarkable  expedition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We found that all our possessions fitted very easily into  the two canoes, and we divided our personnel, six in each, taking the  obvious precaution in the interests of peace of putting one Professor  into each canoe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Personally, I was with Challenger, who was in a  beatific humor, moving about as one in a silent ecstasy and beaming  benevolence from every feature.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have had some experience of him in  other moods, however, and shall be the less surprised when the  thunderstorms suddenly come up amidst the sunshine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If it is  impossible to be at your ease, it is equally impossible to be dull in  his company, for one is always in a state of half-tremulous doubt as to  what sudden turn his formidable temper may take.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For two days we made our way up a good-sized river some hundreds of  yards broad, and dark in color, but transparent, so that one could  usually see the bottom.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The affluents of the Amazon are, half of them,  of this nature, while the other half are whitish and opaque, the  difference depending upon the class of country through which they have  flowed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The dark indicate vegetable decay, while the others point to  clayey soil.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Twice we came across rapids, and in each case made a  portage of half a mile or so to avoid them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The woods on either side  were primeval, which are more easily penetrated than woods of the  second growth, and we had no great difficulty in carrying our canoes  through them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How shall I ever forget the solemn mystery of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  height of the trees and the thickness of the boles exceeded anything  which I in my town-bred life could have imagined, shooting upwards in  magnificent columns until, at an enormous distance above our heads, we  could dimly discern the spot where they threw out their side-branches  into Gothic upward curves which coalesced to form one great matted roof  of verdure, through which only an occasional golden ray of sunshine  shot downwards to trace a thin dazzling line of light amidst the  majestic obscurity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As we walked noiselessly amid the thick, soft  carpet of decaying vegetation the hush fell upon our souls which comes  upon us in the twilight of the Abbey, and even Professor Challenger's  full-chested notes sank into a whisper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Alone, I should have been  ignorant of the names of these giant growths, but our men of science  pointed out the cedars, the great silk cotton trees, and the redwood  trees, with all that profusion of various plants which has made this  continent the chief supplier to the human race of those gifts of Nature  which depend upon the vegetable world, while it is the most backward in  those products which come from animal life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Vivid orchids and  wonderful colored lichens smoldered upon the swarthy tree-trunks and  where a wandering shaft of light fell full upon the golden allamanda,  the scarlet star-clusters of the tacsonia, or the rich deep blue of  ipomaea, the effect was as a dream of fairyland.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In these great wastes  of forest, life, which abhors darkness, struggles ever upwards to the  light.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Every plant, even the smaller ones, curls and writhes to the  green surface, twining itself round its stronger and taller brethren in  the effort.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Climbing plants are monstrous and luxuriant, but others  which have never been known to climb elsewhere learn the art as an  escape from that somber shadow, so that the common nettle, the jasmine,  and even the jacitara palm tree can be seen circling the stems of the  cedars and striving to reach their crowns.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of animal life there was no  movement amid the majestic vaulted aisles which stretched from us as we  walked, but a constant movement far above our heads told of that  multitudinous world of snake and monkey, bird and sloth, which lived in  the sunshine, and looked down in wonder at our tiny, dark, stumbling  figures in the obscure depths immeasurably below them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At dawn and at  sunset the howler monkeys screamed together and the parrakeets broke  into shrill chatter, but during the hot hours of the day only the full  drone of insects, like the beat of a distant surf, filled the ear,  while nothing moved amid the solemn vistas of stupendous trunks, fading  away into the darkness which held us in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once some bandy-legged,  lurching creature, an ant-eater or a bear, scuttled clumsily amid the  shadows.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the only sign of earth life which I saw in this great  Amazonian forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet there were indications that even human life itself was not far  from us in those mysterious recesses.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the third day out we were  aware of a singular deep throbbing in the air, rhythmic and solemn,  coming and going fitfully throughout the morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The two boats were  paddling within a few yards of each other when first we heard it, and  our Indians remained motionless, as if they had been turned to bronze,  listening intently with expressions of terror upon their faces.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What is it, then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Drums," said Lord John, carelessly; "war drums.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have heard them  before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Yes, sir, war drums," said Gomez, the half-breed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Wild Indians,  bravos, not mansos; they watch us every mile of the way; kill us if  they can.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "How can they watch us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked, gazing into the dark, motionless void.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The half-breed shrugged his broad shoulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The Indians know.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They have their own way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They watch us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They talk  the drum talk to each other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Kill us if they can.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    By the afternoon of that day--my pocket diary shows me that it was  Tuesday, August 18th--at least six or seven drums were throbbing from  various points.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sometimes they beat quickly, sometimes slowly,  sometimes in obvious question and answer, one far to the east breaking  out in a high staccato rattle, and being followed after a pause by a  deep roll from the north.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was something indescribably  nerve-shaking and menacing in that constant mutter, which seemed to  shape itself into the very syllables of the half-breed, endlessly  repeated, "We will kill you if we can.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We will kill you if we can.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  No one ever moved in the silent woods.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All the peace and soothing of  quiet Nature lay in that dark curtain of vegetation, but away from  behind there came ever the one message from our fellow-man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We will  kill you if we can," said the men in the east.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We will kill you if we  can," said the men in the north.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All day the drums rumbled and whispered, while their menace reflected  itself in the faces of our colored companions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even the hardy,  swaggering half-breed seemed cowed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I learned, however, that day once  for all that both Summerlee and Challenger possessed that highest type  of bravery, the bravery of the scientific mind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Theirs was the spirit  which upheld Darwin among the gauchos of the Argentine or Wallace among  the head-hunters of Malaya.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is decreed by a merciful Nature that  the human brain cannot think of two things simultaneously, so that if  it be steeped in curiosity as to science it has no room for merely  personal considerations.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All day amid that incessant and mysterious  menace our two Professors watched every bird upon the wing, and every  shrub upon the bank, with many a sharp wordy contention, when the snarl  of Summerlee came quick upon the deep growl of Challenger, but with no  more sense of danger and no more reference to drum-beating Indians than  if they were seated together in the smoking-room of the Royal Society's  Club in St.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>James's Street.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once only did they condescend to discuss  them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Miranha or Amajuaca cannibals," said Challenger, jerking his thumb  towards the reverberating wood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No doubt, sir," Summerlee answered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Like all such tribes, I shall  expect to find them of poly-synthetic speech and of Mongolian type.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Polysynthetic certainly," said Challenger, indulgently.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am not  aware that any other type of language exists in this continent, and I  have notes of more than a hundred.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Mongolian theory I regard with  deep suspicion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I should have thought that even a limited knowledge of comparative  anatomy would have helped to verify it," said Summerlee, bitterly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger thrust out his aggressive chin until he was all beard and  hat-rim.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No doubt, sir, a limited knowledge would have that effect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When one's knowledge is exhaustive, one comes to other conclusions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  They glared at each other in mutual defiance, while all round rose the  distant whisper, "We will kill you--we will kill you if we can.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    That night we moored our canoes with heavy stones for anchors in the  center of the stream, and made every preparation for a possible attack.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Nothing came, however, and with the dawn we pushed upon our way, the  drum-beating dying out behind us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>About three o'clock in the afternoon  we came to a very steep rapid, more than a mile long--the very one in  which Professor Challenger had suffered disaster upon his first  journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I confess that the sight of it consoled me, for it was really  the first direct corroboration, slight as it was, of the truth of his  story.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Indians carried first our canoes and then our stores  through the brushwood, which is very thick at this point, while we four  whites, our rifles on our shoulders, walked between them and any danger  coming from the woods.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Before evening we had successfully passed the  rapids, and made our way some ten miles above them, where we anchored  for the night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At this point I reckoned that we had come not less than  a hundred miles up the tributary from the main stream.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was in the early forenoon of the next day that we made the great  departure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Since dawn Professor Challenger had been acutely uneasy,  continually scanning each bank of the river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly he gave an  exclamation of satisfaction and pointed to a single tree, which  projected at a peculiar angle over the side of the stream.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What do you make of that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is surely an Assai palm," said Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Exactly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was an Assai palm which I took for my landmark.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  secret opening is half a mile onwards upon the other side of the river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There is no break in the trees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That is the wonder and the mystery of  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There where you see light-green rushes instead of dark-green  undergrowth, there between the great cotton woods, that is my private  gate into the unknown.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Push through, and you will understand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was indeed a wonderful place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Having reached the spot marked by a  line of light-green rushes, we poled out two canoes through them for  some hundreds of yards, and eventually emerged into a placid and  shallow stream, running clear and transparent over a sandy bottom.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  may have been twenty yards across, and was banked in on each side by  most luxuriant vegetation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No one who had not observed that for a  short distance reeds had taken the place of shrubs, could possibly have  guessed the existence of such a stream or dreamed of the fairyland  beyond.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a fairyland it was--the most wonderful that the imagination of man  could conceive.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The thick vegetation met overhead, interlacing into a  natural pergola, and through this tunnel of verdure in a golden  twilight flowed the green, pellucid river, beautiful in itself, but  marvelous from the strange tints thrown by the vivid light from above  filtered and tempered in its fall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Clear as crystal, motionless as a  sheet of glass, green as the edge of an iceberg, it stretched in front  of us under its leafy archway, every stroke of our paddles sending a  thousand ripples across its shining surface.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a fitting avenue  to a land of wonders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All sign of the Indians had passed away, but  animal life was more frequent, and the tameness of the creatures showed  that they knew nothing of the hunter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Fuzzy little black-velvet  monkeys, with snow-white teeth and gleaming, mocking eyes, chattered at  us as we passed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With a dull, heavy splash an occasional cayman  plunged in from the bank.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once a dark, clumsy tapir stared at us from  a gap in the bushes, and then lumbered away through the forest; once,  too, the yellow, sinuous form of a great puma whisked amid the  brushwood, and its green, baleful eyes glared hatred at us over its  tawny shoulder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Bird life was abundant, especially the wading birds,  stork, heron, and ibis gathering in little groups, blue, scarlet, and  white, upon every log which jutted from the bank, while beneath us the  crystal water was alive with fish of every shape and color.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For three days we made our way up this tunnel of hazy green sunshine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the longer stretches one could hardly tell as one looked ahead where  the distant green water ended and the distant green archway began.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  deep peace of this strange waterway was unbroken by any sign of man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No Indian here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Too much afraid.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Curupuri," said Gomez.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Curupuri is the spirit of the woods," Lord John explained.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's a  name for any kind of devil.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The poor beggars think that there is  something fearsome in this direction, and therefore they avoid it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    On the third day it became evident that our journey in the canoes could  not last much longer, for the stream was rapidly growing more shallow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Twice in as many hours we stuck upon the bottom.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally we pulled the  boats up among the brushwood and spent the night on the bank of the  river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the morning Lord John and I made our way for a couple of  miles through the forest, keeping parallel with the stream; but as it  grew ever shallower we returned and reported, what Professor Challenger  had already suspected, that we had reached the highest point to which  the canoes could be brought.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We drew them up, therefore, and concealed  them among the bushes, blazing a tree with our axes, so that we should  find them again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then we distributed the various burdens among  us--guns, ammunition, food, a tent, blankets, and the rest--and,  shouldering our packages, we set forth upon the more laborious stage of  our journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>An unfortunate quarrel between our pepper-pots marked the outset of our  new stage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger had from the moment of joining us issued  directions to the whole party, much to the evident discontent of  Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, upon his assigning some duty to his fellow-Professor  (it was only the carrying of an aneroid barometer), the matter suddenly  came to a head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"May I ask, sir," said Summerlee, with vicious calm, "in what capacity  you take it upon yourself to issue these orders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Challenger glared and bristled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I do it, Professor Summerlee, as leader of this expedition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I am compelled to tell you, sir, that I do not recognize you in that  capacity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Indeed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" Challenger bowed with unwieldy sarcasm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Perhaps you would  define my exact position.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Yes, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You are a man whose veracity is upon trial, and this  committee is here to try it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You walk, sir, with your judges.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Dear me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said Challenger, seating himself on the side of one of the  canoes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"In that case you will, of course, go on your way, and I will  follow at my leisure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If I am not the leader you cannot expect me to  lead.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Thank heaven that there were two sane men--Lord John Roxton and  myself--to prevent the petulance and folly of our learned Professors  from sending us back empty-handed to London.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such arguing and pleading  and explaining before we could get them mollified.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then at last  Summerlee, with his sneer and his pipe, would move forwards, and  Challenger would come rolling and grumbling after.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By some good  fortune we discovered about this time that both our savants had the  very poorest opinion of Dr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Illingworth of Edinburgh.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Thenceforward  that was our one safety, and every strained situation was relieved by  our introducing the name of the Scotch zoologist, when both our  Professors would form a temporary alliance and friendship in their  detestation and abuse of this common rival.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Advancing in single file along the bank of the stream, we soon found  that it narrowed down to a mere brook, and finally that it lost itself  in a great green morass of sponge-like mosses, into which we sank up to  our knees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The place was horribly haunted by clouds of mosquitoes and  every form of flying pest, so we were glad to find solid ground again  and to make a circuit among the trees, which enabled us to outflank  this pestilent morass, which droned like an organ in the distance, so  loud was it with insect life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the second day after leaving our canoes we found that the whole  character of the country changed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our road was persistently upwards,  and as we ascended the woods became thinner and lost their tropical  luxuriance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The huge trees of the alluvial Amazonian plain gave place  to the Phoenix and coco palms, growing in scattered clumps, with thick  brushwood between.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the damper hollows the Mauritia palms threw out  their graceful drooping fronds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We traveled entirely by compass, and  once or twice there were differences of opinion between Challenger and  the two Indians, when, to quote the Professor's indignant words, the  whole party agreed to "trust the fallacious instincts of undeveloped  savages rather than the highest product of modern European culture.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  That we were justified in doing so was shown upon the third day, when  Challenger admitted that he recognized several landmarks of his former  journey, and in one spot we actually came upon four fire-blackened  stones, which must have marked a camping-place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The road still ascended, and we crossed a rock-studded slope which took  two days to traverse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The vegetation had again changed, and only the  vegetable ivory tree remained, with a great profusion of wonderful  orchids, among which I learned to recognize the rare Nuttonia  Vexillaria and the glorious pink and scarlet blossoms of Cattleya and  odontoglossum.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Occasional brooks with pebbly bottoms and fern-draped  banks gurgled down the shallow gorges in the hill, and offered good  camping-grounds every evening on the banks of some rock-studded pool,  where swarms of little blue-backed fish, about the size and shape of  English trout, gave us a delicious supper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the ninth day after leaving the canoes, having done, as I reckon,  about a hundred and twenty miles, we began to emerge from the trees,  which had grown smaller until they were mere shrubs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their place was  taken by an immense wilderness of bamboo, which grew so thickly that we  could only penetrate it by cutting a pathway with the machetes and  billhooks of the Indians.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It took us a long day, traveling from seven  in the morning till eight at night, with only two breaks of one hour  each, to get through this obstacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Anything more monotonous and  wearying could not be imagined, for, even at the most open places, I  could not see more than ten or twelve yards, while usually my vision  was limited to the back of Lord John's cotton jacket in front of me,  and to the yellow wall within a foot of me on either side.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From above  came one thin knife-edge of sunshine, and fifteen feet over our heads  one saw the tops of the reeds swaying against the deep blue sky.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I do  not know what kind of creatures inhabit such a thicket, but several  times we heard the plunging of large, heavy animals quite close to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From their sounds Lord John judged them to be some form of wild cattle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Just as night fell we cleared the belt of bamboos, and at once formed  our camp, exhausted by the interminable day.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Early next morning we were again afoot, and found that the character of  the country had changed once again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behind us was the wall of bamboo,  as definite as if it marked the course of a river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In front was an  open plain, sloping slightly upwards and dotted with clumps of  tree-ferns, the whole curving before us until it ended in a long,  whale-backed ridge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This we reached about midday, only to find a  shallow valley beyond, rising once again into a gentle incline which  led to a low, rounded sky-line.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was here, while we crossed the  first of these hills, that an incident occurred which may or may not  have been important.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger, who with the two local Indians was in the van of  the party, stopped suddenly and pointed excitedly to the right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As he  did so we saw, at the distance of a mile or so, something which  appeared to be a huge gray bird flap slowly up from the ground and skim  smoothly off, flying very low and straight, until it was lost among the  tree-ferns.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Did you see it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried Challenger, in exultation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Summerlee, did you  see it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    His colleague was staring at the spot where the creature had  disappeared.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What do you claim that it was.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"To the best of my belief, a pterodactyl.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Summerlee burst into derisive laughter "A pter-fiddlestick.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It was a stork, if ever I saw one.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Challenger was too furious to speak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He simply swung his pack upon his  back and continued upon his march.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John came abreast of me,  however, and his face was more grave than was his wont.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had his  Zeiss glasses in his hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I focused it before it got over the trees," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I won't  undertake to say what it was, but I'll risk my reputation as a  sportsman that it wasn't any bird that ever I clapped eyes on in my  life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    So there the matter stands.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Are we really just at the edge of the  unknown, encountering the outlying pickets of this lost world of which  our leader speaks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I give you the incident as it occurred and you will  know as much as I do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It stands alone, for we saw nothing more which  could be called remarkable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And now, my readers, if ever I have any, I have brought you up the  broad river, and through the screen of rushes, and down the green  tunnel, and up the long slope of palm trees, and through the bamboo  brake, and across the plain of tree-ferns.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last our destination lay  in full sight of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When we had crossed the second ridge we saw  before us an irregular, palm-studded plain, and then the line of high  red cliffs which I have seen in the picture.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There it lies, even as I  write, and there can be no question that it is the same.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At the  nearest point it is about seven miles from our present camp, and it  curves away, stretching as far as I can see.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger struts about  like a prize peacock, and Summerlee is silent, but still sceptical.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Another day should bring some of our doubts to an end.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Meanwhile, as  Jose, whose arm was pierced by a broken bamboo, insists upon returning,  I send this letter back in his charge, and only hope that it may  eventually come to hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I will write again as the occasion serves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  have enclosed with this a rough chart of our journey, which may have  the effect of making the account rather easier to understand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER IX                      "Who could have Foreseen it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    A dreadful thing has happened to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Who could have foreseen it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  cannot foresee any end to our troubles.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It may be that we are  condemned to spend our whole lives in this strange, inaccessible place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am still so confused that I can hardly think clearly of the facts of  the present or of the chances of the future.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To my astounded senses  the one seems most terrible and the other as black as night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No men have ever found themselves in a worse position; nor is there any  use in disclosing to you our exact geographical situation and asking  our friends for a relief party.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even if they could send one, our fate  will in all human probability be decided long before it could arrive in  South America.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are, in truth, as far from any human aid as if we were in the moon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If we are to win through, it is only our own qualities which can save  us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have as companions three remarkable men, men of great  brain-power and of unshaken courage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There lies our one and only hope.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is only when I look upon the untroubled faces of my comrades that I  see some glimmer through the darkness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Outwardly I trust that I appear  as unconcerned as they.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Inwardly I am filled with apprehension.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let me give you, with as much detail as I can, the sequence of events  which have led us to this catastrophe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I finished my last letter I stated that we were within seven miles  from an enormous line of ruddy cliffs, which encircled, beyond all  doubt, the plateau of which Professor Challenger spoke.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their height,  as we approached them, seemed to me in some places to be greater than  he had stated--running up in parts to at least a thousand feet--and  they were curiously striated, in a manner which is, I believe,  characteristic of basaltic upheavals.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Something of the sort is to be  seen in Salisbury Crags at Edinburgh.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The summit showed every sign of  a luxuriant vegetation, with bushes near the edge, and farther back  many high trees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was no indication of any life that we could see.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That night we pitched our camp immediately under the cliff--a most wild  and desolate spot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The crags above us were not merely perpendicular,  but curved outwards at the top, so that ascent was out of the question.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Close to us was the high thin pinnacle of rock which I believe I  mentioned earlier in this narrative.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is like a broad red church  spire, the top of it being level with the plateau, but a great chasm  gaping between.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the summit of it there grew one high tree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Both  pinnacle and cliff were comparatively low--some five or six hundred  feet, I should think.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It was on that," said Professor Challenger, pointing to this tree,  "that the pterodactyl was perched.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I climbed half-way up the rock  before I shot him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am inclined to think that a good mountaineer like  myself could ascend the rock to the top, though he would, of course, be  no nearer to the plateau when he had done so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    As Challenger spoke of his pterodactyl I glanced at Professor  Summerlee, and for the first time I seemed to see some signs of a  dawning credulity and repentance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was no sneer upon his thin  lips, but, on the contrary, a gray, drawn look of excitement and  amazement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger saw it, too, and reveled in the first taste of  victory.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Of course," said he,  with his clumsy and ponderous sarcasm,  "Professor Summerlee will understand that when I speak of a pterodactyl  I mean a stork--only it is the kind of stork which has no feathers, a  leathery skin, membranous wings, and teeth in its jaws.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  He grinned  and blinked and bowed until his colleague turned and walked away.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the morning, after a frugal breakfast of coffee and manioc--we had  to be economical of our stores--we held a council of war as to the best  method of ascending to the plateau above us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger presided with a solemnity as if he were the Lord Chief  Justice on the Bench.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Picture him seated upon a rock, his absurd  boyish straw hat tilted on the back of his head, his supercilious eyes  dominating us from under his drooping lids, his great black beard  wagging as he slowly defined our present situation and our future  movements.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Beneath him you might have seen the three of us--myself, sunburnt,  young, and vigorous after our open-air tramp; Summerlee, solemn but  still critical, behind his eternal pipe; Lord John, as keen as a  razor-edge, with his supple, alert figure leaning upon his rifle, and  his eager eyes fixed eagerly upon the speaker.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behind us were grouped  the two swarthy half-breeds and the little knot of Indians, while in  front and above us towered those huge, ruddy ribs of rocks which kept  us from our goal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I need not say," said our leader, "that on the occasion of my last  visit I exhausted every means of climbing the cliff, and where I failed  I do not think that anyone else is likely to succeed, for I am  something of a mountaineer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had none of the appliances of a  rock-climber with me, but I have taken the precaution to bring them  now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With their aid I am positive I could climb that detached pinnacle  to the summit; but so long as the main cliff overhangs, it is vain to  attempt ascending that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was hurried upon my last visit by the  approach of the rainy season and by the exhaustion of my supplies.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These considerations limited my time, and I can only claim that I have  surveyed about six miles of the cliff to the east of us, finding no  possible way up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What, then, shall we now do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "There seems to be only one reasonable course," said Professor  Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"If you have explored the east, we should travel along the  base of the cliff to the west, and seek for a practicable point for our  ascent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "That's it," said Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The odds are that this plateau is of no  great size, and we shall travel round it until we either find an easy  way up it, or come back to the point from which we started.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I have already explained to our young friend here," said Challenger  (he has a way of alluding to me as if I were a school child ten years  old), "that it is quite impossible that there should be an easy way up  anywhere, for the simple reason that if there were the summit would not  be isolated, and those conditions would not obtain which have effected  so singular an interference with the general laws of survival.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yet I  admit that there may very well be places where an expert human climber  may reach the summit, and yet a cumbrous and heavy animal be unable to  descend.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is certain that there is a point where an ascent is  possible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "How do you know that, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" asked Summerlee, sharply.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Because my predecessor, the American Maple White, actually made such  an ascent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How otherwise could he have seen the monster which he  sketched in his notebook.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "There you reason somewhat ahead of the proved facts," said the  stubborn Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I admit your plateau, because I have seen it; but  I have not as yet satisfied myself that it contains any form of life  whatever.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What you admit, sir, or what you do not admit, is really of  inconceivably small importance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am glad to perceive that the plateau  itself has actually obtruded itself upon your intelligence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He glanced  up at it, and then, to our amazement, he sprang from his rock, and,  seizing Summerlee by the neck, he tilted his face into the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Now  sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he shouted, hoarse with excitement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Do I help you to realize  that the plateau contains some animal life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I have said that a thick fringe of green overhung the edge of the  cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Out of this there had emerged a black, glistening object.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As  it came slowly forth and overhung the chasm, we saw that it was a very  large snake with a peculiar flat, spade-like head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It wavered and  quivered above us for a minute, the morning sun gleaming upon its  sleek, sinuous coils.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then it slowly drew inwards and disappeared.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee had been so interested that he had stood unresisting while  Challenger tilted his head into the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now he shook his colleague  off and came back to his dignity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I should be glad, Professor Challenger," said he, "if you could see  your way to make any remarks which may occur to you without seizing me  by the chin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even the appearance of a very ordinary rock python does  not appear to justify such a liberty.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But there is life upon the plateau all the same," his colleague  replied in triumph.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"And now, having demonstrated this important  conclusion so that it is clear to anyone, however prejudiced or obtuse,  I am of opinion that we cannot do better than break up our camp and  travel to westward until we find some means of ascent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The ground at the foot of the cliff was rocky and broken so that the  going was slow and difficult.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly we came, however, upon  something which cheered our hearts.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the site of an old  encampment, with several empty Chicago meat tins, a bottle labeled  "Brandy," a broken tin-opener, and a quantity of other travelers'  debris.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A crumpled, disintegrated newspaper revealed itself as the  Chicago Democrat, though the date had been obliterated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Not mine," said Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It must be Maple White's.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Lord John had been gazing curiously at a great tree-fern which  overshadowed the encampment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I say, look at this," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I  believe it is meant for a sign-post.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    A slip of hard wood had been nailed to the tree in such a way as to  point to the westward.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Most certainly a sign-post," said Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What else.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finding  himself upon a dangerous errand, our pioneer has left this sign so that  any party which follows him may know the way he has taken.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps we  shall come upon some other indications as we proceed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    We did indeed, but they were of a terrible and most unexpected nature.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Immediately beneath the cliff there grew a considerable patch of high  bamboo, like that which we had traversed in our journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Many of these  stems were twenty feet high, with sharp, strong tops, so that even as  they stood they made formidable spears.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were passing along the edge  of this cover when my eye was caught by the gleam of something white  within it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Thrusting in my head between the stems, I found myself  gazing at a fleshless skull.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The whole skeleton was there, but the  skull had detached itself and lay some feet nearer to the open.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With a few blows from the machetes of our Indians we cleared the spot  and were able to study the details of this old tragedy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Only a few  shreds of clothes could still be distinguished, but there were the  remains of boots upon the bony feet, and it was very clear that the  dead man was a European.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A gold watch by Hudson, of New York, and a  chain which held a stylographic pen, lay among the bones.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was  also a silver cigarette-case, with "J.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>C.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>, from A.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>E.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>S.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>," upon the  lid.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The state of the metal seemed to show that the catastrophe had  occurred no great time before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Who can he be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" asked Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Poor devil.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>every bone in his body  seems to be broken.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And the bamboo grows through his smashed ribs," said Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It  is a fast-growing plant, but it is surely inconceivable that this body  could have been here while the canes grew to be twenty feet in length.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "As to the man's identity," said Professor Challenger, "I have no doubt  whatever upon that point.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I made my way up the river before I  reached you at the fazenda I instituted very particular inquiries about  Maple White.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At Para they knew nothing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Fortunately, I had a definite  clew, for there was a particular picture in his sketch-book which  showed him taking lunch with a certain ecclesiastic at Rosario.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This  priest I was able to find, and though he proved a very argumentative  fellow, who took it absurdly amiss that I should point out to him the  corrosive effect which modern science must have upon his beliefs, he  none the less gave me some positive information.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Maple White passed  Rosario four years ago, or two years before I saw his dead body.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He  was not alone at the time, but there was a friend, an American named  James Colver, who remained in the boat and did not meet this  ecclesiastic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I think, therefore, that there can be no doubt that we  are now looking upon the remains of this James Colver.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Nor," said Lord John, "is there much doubt as to how he met his death.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He has fallen or been chucked from the top, and so been impaled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How  else could he come by his broken bones, and how could he have been  stuck through by these canes with their points so high above our heads.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    A hush came over us as we stood round these shattered remains and  realized the truth of Lord John Roxton's words.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The beetling head of  the cliff projected over the cane-brake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Undoubtedly he had fallen  from above.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But had he fallen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Had it been an accident.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Or--already  ominous and terrible possibilities began to form round that unknown  land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We moved off in silence, and continued to coast round the line of  cliffs, which were as even and unbroken as some of those monstrous  Antarctic ice-fields which I have seen depicted as stretching from  horizon to horizon and towering high above the mast-heads of the  exploring vessel.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In five miles we saw no rift or break.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And then suddenly we perceived  something which filled us with new hope.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a hollow of the rock,  protected from rain, there was drawn a rough arrow in chalk, pointing  still to the westwards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Maple White again," said Professor Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"He had some  presentiment that worthy footsteps would follow close behind him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "He had chalk, then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A box of colored chalks was among the effects I found in his knapsack.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I remember that the white one was worn to a stump.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "That is certainly good evidence," said Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We can only accept  his guidance and follow on to the westward.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    We had proceeded some five more miles when again we saw a white arrow  upon the rocks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was at a point where the face of the cliff was for  the first time split into a narrow cleft.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Inside the cleft was a  second guidance mark, which pointed right up it with the tip somewhat  elevated, as if the spot indicated were above the level of the ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a solemn place, for the walls were so gigantic and the slit of  blue sky so narrow and so obscured by a double fringe of verdure, that  only a dim and shadowy light penetrated to the bottom.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had had no  food for many hours, and were very weary with the stony and irregular  journey, but our nerves were too strung to allow us to halt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We  ordered the camp to be pitched, however, and, leaving the Indians to  arrange it, we four, with the two half-breeds, proceeded up the narrow  gorge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was not more than forty feet across at the mouth, but it rapidly  closed until it ended in an acute angle, too straight and smooth for an  ascent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Certainly it was not this which our pioneer had attempted to  indicate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We made our way back--the whole gorge was not more than a  quarter of a mile deep--and then suddenly the quick eyes of Lord John  fell upon what we were seeking.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>High up above our heads, amid the dark  shadows, there was one circle of deeper gloom.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Surely it could only be  the opening of a cave.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The base of the cliff was heaped with loose stones at the spot, and it  was not difficult to clamber up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When we reached it, all doubt was  removed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Not only was it an opening into the rock, but on the side of  it there was marked once again the sign of the arrow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here was the  point, and this the means by which Maple White and his ill-fated  comrade had made their ascent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were too excited to return to the camp, but must make our first  exploration at once.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John had an electric torch in his knapsack,  and this had to serve us as light.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He advanced, throwing his little  clear circlet of yellow radiance before him, while in single file we  followed at his heels.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The cave had evidently been water-worn, the sides being smooth and the  floor covered with rounded stones.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was of such a size that a single  man could just fit through by stooping.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For fifty yards it ran almost  straight into the rock, and then it ascended at an angle of forty-five.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Presently this incline became even steeper, and we found ourselves  climbing upon hands and knees among loose rubble which slid from  beneath us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly an exclamation broke from Lord Roxton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's blocked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Clustering behind him we saw in the yellow field of light a wall of  broken basalt which extended to the ceiling.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The roof has fallen in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    In vain we dragged out some of the pieces.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The only effect was that  the larger ones became detached and threatened to roll down the  gradient and crush us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was evident that the obstacle was far beyond  any efforts which we could make to remove it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The road by which Maple  White had ascended was no longer available.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Too much cast down to speak, we stumbled down the dark tunnel and made  our way back to the camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One incident occurred, however, before we left the gorge, which is of  importance in view of what came afterwards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had gathered in a little group at the bottom of the chasm, some  forty feet beneath the mouth of the cave, when a huge rock rolled  suddenly downwards--and shot past us with tremendous force.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the  narrowest escape for one or all of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We could not ourselves see  whence the rock had come, but our half-breed servants, who were still  at the opening of the cave, said that it had flown past them, and must  therefore have fallen from the summit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Looking upwards, we could see  no sign of movement above us amidst the green jungle which topped the  cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There could be little doubt, however, that the stone was aimed  at us, so the incident surely pointed to humanity--and malevolent  humanity--upon the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We withdrew hurriedly from the chasm, our minds full of this new  development and its bearing upon our plans.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The situation was  difficult enough before, but if the obstructions of Nature were  increased by the deliberate opposition of man, then our case was indeed  a hopeless one.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet, as we looked up at that beautiful fringe of  verdure only a few hundreds of feet above our heads, there was not one  of us who could conceive the idea of returning to London until we had  explored it to its depths.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On discussing the situation, we determined that our best course was to  continue to coast round the plateau in the hope of finding some other  means of reaching the top.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The line of cliffs, which had decreased  considerably in height, had already begun to trend from west to north,  and if we could take this as representing the arc of a circle, the  whole circumference could not be very great.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At the worst, then, we  should be back in a few days at our starting-point.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We made a march that day which totaled some two-and-twenty miles,  without any change in our prospects.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I may mention that our aneroid  shows us that in the continual incline which we have ascended since we  abandoned our canoes we have risen to no less than three thousand feet  above sea-level.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Hence there is a considerable change both in the  temperature and in the vegetation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We have shaken off some of that  horrible insect life which is the bane of tropical travel.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A few palms  still survive, and many tree-ferns, but the Amazonian trees have been  all left behind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was pleasant to see the convolvulus, the  passion-flower, and the begonia, all reminding me of home, here among  these inhospitable rocks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a red begonia just the same color  as one that is kept in a pot in the window of a certain villa in  Streatham--but I am drifting into private reminiscence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That night--I am still speaking of the first day of our  circumnavigation of the plateau--a great experience awaited us, and one  which for ever set at rest any doubt which we could have had as to the  wonders so near us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You will realize as you read it, my dear Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>McArdle, and possibly for  the first time that the paper has not sent me on a wild-goose chase,  and that there is inconceivably fine copy waiting for the world  whenever we have the Professor's leave to make use of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I shall not  dare to publish these articles unless I can bring back my proofs to  England, or I shall be hailed as the journalistic Munchausen of all  time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself, and that  you would not care to stake the whole credit of the Gazette upon this  adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism  which such articles must of necessity elicit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So this wonderful  incident, which would make such a headline for the old paper, must  still wait its turn in the editorial drawer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet it was all over in a flash, and there was no sequel to it, save  in our own convictions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What occurred was this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John had shot an ajouti--which is a  small, pig-like animal--and, half of it having been given to the  Indians, we were cooking the other half upon our fire.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There is a  chill in the  air after dark, and we had all drawn close to the blaze.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The night was moonless, but there were some stars, and one could see  for a little distance across the plain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, suddenly out of the  darkness, out of the night, there swooped something with a swish like  an aeroplane.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The whole group of us were covered for an instant by a  canopy of leathery wings, and I had a momentary vision of a long,  snake-like neck, a fierce, red, greedy eye, and a great snapping beak,  filled, to my amazement, with little, gleaming teeth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The next instant  it was gone--and so was our dinner.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A huge black shadow, twenty feet  across, skimmed up into the air; for an instant the monster wings  blotted out the stars, and then it vanished over the brow of the cliff  above us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We all sat in amazed silence round the fire, like the heroes  of Virgil when the Harpies came down upon them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was Summerlee who  was the first to speak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Professor Challenger," said he, in a solemn voice, which quavered with  emotion, "I owe you an apology.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sir, I am very much in the wrong, and  I beg that you will forget what is past.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was handsomely said, and the two men for the first time shook hands.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So much we have gained by this clear vision of our first pterodactyl.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was worth a stolen supper to bring two such men together.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But if prehistoric life existed upon the plateau it was not  superabundant, for we had no further glimpse of it during the next  three days.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>During this time we traversed a barren and forbidding  country, which alternated between stony desert and desolate marshes  full of many wild-fowl, upon the north and east of the cliffs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From  that direction the place is really inaccessible, and, were it not for a  hardish ledge which runs at the very base of the precipice, we should  have had to turn back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Many times we were up to our waists in the  slime and blubber of an old, semi-tropical swamp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To make matters  worse, the place seemed to be a favorite breeding-place of the Jaracaca  snake, the most venomous and aggressive in South America.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Again and  again these horrible creatures came writhing and springing towards us  across the surface of this putrid bog, and it was only by keeping our  shot-guns for ever ready that we could feel safe from them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One  funnel-shaped depression in the morass, of a livid green in color from  some lichen which festered in it, will always remain as a nightmare  memory in my mind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It seems to have been a special nest of these  vermins, and the slopes were alive with them, all writhing in our  direction, for it is a peculiarity of the Jaracaca that he will always  attack man at first sight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were too many for us to shoot, so we  fairly took to our heels and ran until we were exhausted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I shall  always remember as we looked back how far behind we could see the heads  and necks of our horrible pursuers rising and falling amid the reeds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Jaracaca Swamp we named it in the map which we are constructing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The cliffs upon the farther side had lost their ruddy tint, being  chocolate-brown in color; the vegetation was more scattered along the  top of them, and they had sunk to three or four hundred feet in height,  but in no place did we find any point where they could be ascended.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If  anything, they were more impossible than at the first point where we  had met them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their absolute steepness is indicated in the photograph  which I took over the stony desert.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Surely," said I, as we discussed the situation, "the rain must find  its way down somehow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are bound to be water-channels in the  rocks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Our young friend has glimpses of lucidity," said Professor Challenger,  patting me upon the shoulder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The rain must go somewhere," I repeated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"He keeps a firm grip upon actuality.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The only drawback is that we  have conclusively proved by ocular demonstration that there are no  water channels down the rocks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Where, then, does it go.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I persisted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I think it may be fairly assumed that if it does not come outwards it  must run inwards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then there is a lake in the center.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "So I should suppose.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is more than likely that the lake may be an old crater," said  Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The whole formation is, of course, highly volcanic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But,  however that may be, I should expect to find the surface of the plateau  slope inwards with a considerable sheet of water in the center, which  may drain off, by some subterranean channel, into the marshes of the  Jaracaca Swamp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Or evaporation might preserve an equilibrium," remarked Challenger,  and the two learned men wandered off into one of their usual scientific  arguments, which were as comprehensible as Chinese to the layman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the sixth day we completed our first circuit of the cliffs, and  found ourselves back at the first camp, beside the isolated pinnacle of  rock.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were a disconsolate party, for nothing could have been more  minute than our investigation, and it was absolutely certain that there  was no single point where the most active human being could possibly  hope to scale the cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The place which Maple White's chalk-marks had  indicated as his own means of access was now entirely impassable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What were we to do now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our stores of provisions, supplemented by our  guns, were holding out well, but the day must come when they would need  replenishment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a couple of months the rains might be expected, and  we should be washed out of our camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The rock was harder than marble,  and any attempt at cutting a path for so great a height was more than  our time or resources would admit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No wonder that we looked gloomily  at each other that night, and sought our blankets with hardly a word  exchanged.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I remember that as I dropped off to sleep my last  recollection was that Challenger was squatting, like a monstrous  bull-frog, by the fire, his huge head in his hands, sunk apparently in  the deepest thought, and entirely oblivious to the good-night which I  wished him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But it was a very different Challenger who greeted us in the morning--a  Challenger with contentment and self-congratulation shining from his  whole person.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He faced us as we assembled for breakfast with a  deprecating false modesty in his eyes, as who should say, "I know that  I deserve all that you can say, but I pray you to spare my blushes by  not saying it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  His beard bristled exultantly, his chest was thrown  out, and his hand was thrust into the front of his jacket.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So, in his  fancy, may he see himself sometimes, gracing the vacant pedestal in  Trafalgar Square, and adding one more to the horrors of the London  streets.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Eureka.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried, his teeth shining through his beard.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Gentlemen,  you may congratulate me and we may congratulate each other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  problem is solved.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You have found a way up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I venture to think so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And where.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    For answer he pointed to the spire-like pinnacle upon our right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our faces--or mine, at least--fell as we surveyed it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That it could be  climbed we had our companion's assurance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But a horrible abyss lay  between it and the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We can never get across," I gasped.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We can at least all reach the summit," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"When we are up I may  be able to show you that the resources of an inventive mind are not yet  exhausted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    After breakfast we unpacked the bundle in which our leader had brought  his climbing accessories.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From it he took a coil of the strongest and  lightest rope, a hundred and fifty feet in length, with climbing irons,  clamps, and other devices.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John was an experienced mountaineer,  and Summerlee had done some rough climbing at various times, so that I  was really the novice at rock-work of the party; but my strength and  activity may have made up for my want of experience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was not in reality a very stiff task, though there were moments  which made my hair bristle upon my head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The first half was perfectly  easy, but from there upwards it became continually steeper until, for  the last fifty feet, we were literally clinging with our fingers and  toes to tiny ledges and crevices in the rock.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could not have  accomplished it, nor could Summerlee, if Challenger had not gained the  summit (it was extraordinary to see such activity in so unwieldy a  creature) and there fixed the rope round the trunk of the considerable  tree which grew there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With this as our support, we were soon able to  scramble up the jagged wall until we found ourselves upon the small  grassy platform, some twenty-five feet each way, which formed the  summit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The first impression which I received when I had recovered my breath  was of the extraordinary view over the country which we had traversed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The whole Brazilian plain seemed to lie beneath us, extending away and  away until it ended in dim blue mists upon the farthest sky-line.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In  the foreground was the long slope, strewn with rocks and dotted with  tree-ferns; farther off in the middle distance, looking over the  saddle-back hill, I could just see the yellow and green mass of bamboos  through which we had passed; and then, gradually, the vegetation  increased until it formed the huge forest which extended as far as the  eyes could reach, and for a good two thousand miles beyond.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was still drinking in this wonderful panorama when the heavy hand of  the Professor fell upon my shoulder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"This way, my young friend," said he; "vestigia nulla retrorsum.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Never  look rearwards, but always to our glorious goal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The level of the plateau, when I turned, was exactly that on which we  stood, and the green bank of bushes, with occasional trees, was so near  that it was difficult to realize how inaccessible it remained.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At a  rough guess the gulf was forty feet across, but, so far as I could see,  it might as well have been forty miles.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I placed one arm round the  trunk of the tree and leaned over the abyss.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Far down were the small  dark figures of our servants, looking up at us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The wall was  absolutely precipitous, as was that which faced me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"This is indeed curious," said the creaking voice of Professor  Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I turned, and found that he was examining with great interest the tree  to which I clung.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That smooth bark and those small, ribbed leaves  seemed familiar to my eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Why," I cried, "it's a beech.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Exactly," said Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"A fellow-countryman in a far land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Not only a fellow-countryman, my good sir," said Challenger, "but  also, if I may be allowed to enlarge your simile, an ally of the first  value.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This beech tree will be our saviour.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "By George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried Lord John, "a bridge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Exactly, my friends, a bridge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is not for nothing that I expended  an hour last night in focusing my mind upon the situation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have some  recollection of once remarking to our young friend here that G.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>E.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>C.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>is at his best when his back is to the wall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Last night you will admit  that all our backs were to the wall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But where will-power and  intellect go together, there is always a way out.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A drawbridge had to  be found which could be dropped across the abyss.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behold it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was certainly a brilliant idea.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The tree was a good sixty feet in  height, and if it only fell the right way it would easily cross the  chasm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger had slung the camp axe over his shoulder when he  ascended.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now he handed it to me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Our young friend has the thews and sinews," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I think he will  be the most useful at this task.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I must beg, however, that you will  kindly refrain from thinking for yourself, and that you will do exactly  what you are told.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Under his direction I cut such gashes in the sides of the trees as  would ensure that it should fall as we desired.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It had already a  strong, natural tilt in the direction of the plateau, so that the  matter was not difficult.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally I set to work in earnest upon the  trunk, taking turn and turn with Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a little over an hour  there was a loud crack, the tree swayed forward, and then crashed over,  burying its branches among the bushes on the farther side.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The severed  trunk rolled to the very edge of our platform, and for one terrible  second we all thought it was over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It balanced itself, however, a few  inches from the edge, and there was our bridge to the unknown.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All of us, without a word, shook hands with Professor Challenger, who  raised his straw hat and bowed deeply to each in turn.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I claim the honor," said he, "to be the first to cross to the unknown  land--a fitting subject, no doubt, for some future historical painting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He had approached the bridge when Lord John laid his hand upon his coat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"My dear chap," said he, "I really cannot allow it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Cannot allow it, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  The head went back and the beard forward.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"When it is a matter of science, don't you know, I follow your lead  because you are by way of bein' a man of science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But it's up to you  to follow me when you come into my department.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Your department, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We all have our professions, and soldierin' is mine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are,  accordin' to my ideas, invadin' a new country, which may or may not be  chock-full of enemies of sorts.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To barge blindly into it for want of a  little common sense and patience isn't my notion of management.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The remonstrance was too reasonable to be disregarded.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger  tossed his head and shrugged his heavy shoulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, sir, what do you propose.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "For all I know there may be a tribe of cannibals waitin' for  lunch-time among those very bushes," said Lord John, looking across the  bridge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's better to learn wisdom before you get into a  cookin'-pot; so we will content ourselves with hopin' that there is no  trouble waitin' for us, and at the same time we will act as if there  were.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone and I will go down again, therefore, and we will fetch up  the four rifles, together with Gomez and the other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One man can then  go across and the rest will cover him with guns, until he sees that it  is safe for the whole crowd to come along.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Challenger sat down upon the cut stump and groaned his impatience; but  Summerlee and I were of one mind that Lord John was our leader when  such practical details were in question.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The climb was a more simple  thing now that the rope dangled down the face of the worst part of the  ascent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Within an hour we had brought up the rifles and a shot-gun.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The half-breeds had ascended also, and under Lord John's orders they  had carried up a bale of provisions in case our first exploration  should be a long one.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had each bandoliers of cartridges.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Now, Challenger, if you really insist upon being the first man in,"  said Lord John, when every preparation was complete.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am much indebted to you for your gracious permission," said the  angry Professor; for never was a man so intolerant of every form of  authority.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Since you are good enough to allow it, I shall most  certainly take it upon myself to act as pioneer upon this occasion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Seating himself with a leg overhanging the abyss on each side, and his  hatchet slung upon his back, Challenger hopped his way across the trunk  and was soon at the other side.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He clambered up and waved his arms in  the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"At last.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried; "at last.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I gazed anxiously at him, with a vague expectation that some terrible  fate would dart at him from the curtain of green behind him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But all  was quiet, save that a strange, many-colored bird flew up from under  his feet and vanished among the trees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee was the second.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His wiry energy is wonderful in so frail a  frame.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He insisted upon having two rifles slung upon his back, so that  both Professors were armed when he had made his transit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I came next,  and tried hard not to look down into the horrible gulf over which I was  passing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee held out the butt-end of his rifle, and an instant  later I was able to grasp his hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to Lord John, he walked  across--actually walked without support.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He must have nerves of iron.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And there we were, the four of us, upon the dreamland, the lost world,  of Maple White.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To all of us it seemed the moment of our supreme  triumph.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Who could have guessed that it was the prelude to our supreme  disaster.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let me say in a few words how the crushing blow fell upon us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had turned away from the edge, and had penetrated about fifty yards  of close brushwood, when there came a frightful rending crash from  behind us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With one impulse we rushed back the way that we had come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The bridge was gone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Far down at the base of the cliff I saw, as I looked over, a tangled  mass of branches and splintered trunk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was our beech tree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Had the  edge of the platform crumbled and let it through.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment this  explanation was in all our minds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The next, from the farther side of  the rocky pinnacle before us a swarthy face, the face of Gomez the  half-breed, was slowly protruded.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yes, it was Gomez, but no longer the  Gomez of the demure smile and the mask-like expression.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here was a  face with flashing eyes and distorted features, a face convulsed with  hatred and with the mad joy of gratified revenge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Lord Roxton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he shouted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Lord John Roxton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well," said our companion, "here I am.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    A shriek of laughter came across the abyss.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Yes, there you are, you English dog, and there you will remain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  have waited and waited, and now has come my chance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You found it hard  to get up; you will find it harder to get down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You cursed fools, you  are trapped, every one of you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    We were too astounded to speak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We could only stand there staring in  amazement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A great broken bough upon the grass showed whence he had  gained his leverage to tilt over our bridge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The face had vanished,  but presently it was up again, more frantic than before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We nearly killed you with a stone at the cave," he cried; "but this is  better.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is slower and more terrible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Your bones will whiten up  there, and none will know where you lie or come to cover them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As you  lie dying, think of Lopez, whom you shot five years ago on the Putomayo  River.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am his brother, and, come what will I will die happy now, for  his memory has been avenged.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" A furious hand was shaken at us, and then  all was quiet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Had the half-breed simply wrought his vengeance and then escaped, all  might have been well with him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was that foolish, irresistible Latin  impulse to be dramatic which brought his own downfall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Roxton, the man  who had earned himself the name of the Flail of the Lord through three  countries, was not one who could be safely taunted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The half-breed was  descending on the farther side of the pinnacle; but before he could  reach the ground Lord John had run along the edge of the plateau and  gained a point from which he could see his man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a single  crack of his rifle, and, though we saw nothing, we heard the scream and  then the distant thud of the falling body.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Roxton came back to us with  a face of granite.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I have been a blind simpleton," said he, bitterly,  "It's my folly  that has brought you all into this trouble.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I should have remembered  that these people have long memories for blood-feuds, and have been  more upon my guard.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What about the other one.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It took two of them to lever that tree over  the edge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I could have shot him, but I let him go.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He may have had no part in  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps it would have been better if I had killed him, for he  must, as you say, have lent a hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Now that we had the clue to his action, each of us could cast back and  remember some sinister act upon the part of the half-breed--his  constant desire to know our plans, his arrest outside our tent when he  was over-hearing them, the furtive looks of hatred which from time to  time one or other of us had surprised.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were still discussing it,  endeavoring to adjust our minds to these new conditions, when a  singular scene in the plain below arrested our attention.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A man in white clothes, who could only be the surviving half-breed, was  running as one does run when Death is the pacemaker.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behind him, only  a few yards in his rear, bounded the huge ebony figure of Zambo, our  devoted negro.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even as we looked, he sprang upon the back of the  fugitive and flung his arms round his neck.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They rolled on the ground  together.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>An instant afterwards Zambo rose, looked at the prostrate  man, and then, waving his hand joyously to us, came running in our  direction.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The white figure lay motionless in the middle of the great  plain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our two traitors had been destroyed, but the mischief that they had  done lived after them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By no possible means could we get back to the  pinnacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had been natives of the world; now we were natives of the  plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The two things were separate and apart.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was the plain  which led to the canoes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yonder, beyond the violet, hazy horizon, was  the stream which led back to civilization.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But the link between was  missing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No human ingenuity could suggest a means of bridging the  chasm which yawned between ourselves and our past lives.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One instant  had altered the whole conditions of our existence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was at such a moment that I learned the stuff of which my three  comrades were composed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were grave, it is true, and thoughtful,  but of an invincible serenity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For the moment we could only sit among  the bushes in patience and wait the coming of Zambo.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Presently his  honest black face topped the rocks and his Herculean figure emerged  upon the top of the pinnacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What I do now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You tell me and I do it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was a question which it was easier to ask than to answer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One thing  only was clear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was our one trusty link with the outside world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On  no account must he leave us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No no.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I not leave you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Whatever come, you always find  me here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But no able to keep Indians.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Already they say too much  Curupuri live on this place, and they go home.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now you leave them me  no able to keep them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was a fact that our Indians had shown in many ways of late that they  were weary of their journey and anxious to return.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We realized that  Zambo spoke the truth, and that it would be impossible for him to keep  them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Make them wait till to-morrow, Zambo," I shouted; "then I can send  letter back by them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Very good, sarr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I promise they wait till to-morrow," said the negro.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But what I do for you now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    There was plenty for him to do, and admirably the faithful fellow did  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>First of all, under our directions, he undid the rope from the  tree-stump and threw one end of it across to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was not thicker  than a clothes-line, but it was of great strength, and though we could  not make a bridge of it, we might well find it invaluable if we had any  climbing to do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He then fastened his end of the rope to the package of  supplies which had been carried up, and we were able to drag it across.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This gave us the means of life for at least a week, even if we found  nothing else.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally he descended and carried up two other packets of  mixed goods--a box of ammunition and a number of other things, all of  which we got across by throwing our rope to him and hauling it back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was evening when he at last climbed down, with a final assurance  that he would keep the Indians till next morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And so it is that I have spent nearly the whole of this our first night  upon the plateau writing up our experiences by the light of a single  candle-lantern.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We supped and camped at the very edge of the cliff, quenching our  thirst with two bottles of Apollinaris which were in one of the cases.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is vital to us to find water, but I think even Lord John himself had  had adventures enough for one day, and none of us felt inclined to make  the first push into the unknown.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We forbore to light a fire or to make  any unnecessary sound.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To-morrow (or to-day, rather, for it is already dawn as I write) we  shall make our first venture into this strange land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I shall be  able to write again--or if I ever shall write again--I know not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Meanwhile, I can see that the Indians are still in their place, and I  am sure that the faithful Zambo will be here presently to get my  letter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I only trust that it will come to hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>P.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>S.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>--The more I think the more desperate does our position seem.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  see no possible hope of our return.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If there were a high tree near the  edge of the plateau we might drop a return bridge across, but there is  none within fifty yards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our united strength could not carry a trunk  which would serve our purpose.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The rope, of course, is far too short  that we could descend by it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No, our position is hopeless--hopeless.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER X                "The most Wonderful Things have Happened"    The most wonderful things have happened and are continually happening  to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All the paper that I possess consists of five old note-books  and a lot of scraps, and I have only the one stylographic pencil; but  so long as I can move my hand I will continue to set down our  experiences and impressions, for, since we are the only men of the  whole human race to see such things, it is of enormous importance that  I should record them whilst they are fresh in my memory and before that  fate which seems to be constantly impending does actually overtake us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Whether Zambo can at last take these letters to the river, or whether I  shall myself in some miraculous way carry them back with me, or,  finally, whether some daring explorer, coming upon our tracks with the  advantage, perhaps, of a perfected monoplane, should find this bundle  of manuscript, in any case I can see that what I am writing is destined  to immortality as a classic of true adventure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the morning after our being trapped upon the plateau by the  villainous Gomez we began a new stage in our experiences.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The first  incident in it was not such as to give me a very favorable opinion of  the place to which we had wandered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I roused myself from a short  nap after day had dawned, my eyes fell upon a most singular appearance  upon my own leg.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My trouser had slipped up, exposing a few inches of  my skin above my sock.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On this there rested a large, purplish grape.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Astonished at the sight, I leaned forward to pick it off, when, to my  horror, it burst between my finger and thumb, squirting blood in every  direction.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My cry of disgust had brought the two professors to my side.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Most interesting," said Summerlee, bending over my shin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"An enormous  blood-tick, as yet, I believe, unclassified.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "The first-fruits of our labors," said Challenger in his booming,  pedantic fashion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We cannot do less than call it Ixodes Maloni.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  very small inconvenience of being bitten, my young friend, cannot, I am  sure, weigh with you as against the glorious privilege of having your  name inscribed in the deathless roll of zoology.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Unhappily you have  crushed this fine specimen at the moment of satiation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Filthy vermin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger raised his great eyebrows in protest, and placed a  soothing paw upon my shoulder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You should cultivate the scientific eye and the detached scientific  mind," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"To a man of philosophic temperament like myself the  blood-tick, with its lancet-like proboscis and its distending stomach,  is as beautiful a work of Nature as the peacock or, for that matter,  the aurora borealis.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It pains me to hear you speak of it in so  unappreciative a fashion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No doubt, with due diligence, we can secure  some other specimen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "There can be no doubt of that," said Summerlee, grimly, "for one has  just disappeared behind your shirt-collar.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Challenger sprang into the air bellowing like a bull, and tore  frantically at his coat and shirt to get them off.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee and I  laughed so that we could hardly help him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last we exposed that  monstrous torso (fifty-four inches, by the tailor's tape).
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His body  was all matted with black hair, out of which jungle we picked the  wandering tick before it had bitten him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But the bushes round were  full of the horrible pests, and it was clear that we must shift our  camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But first of all it was necessary to make our arrangements with the  faithful negro, who appeared presently on the pinnacle with a number of  tins of cocoa and biscuits, which he tossed over to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of the stores  which remained below he was ordered to retain as much as would keep him  for two months.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Indians were to have the remainder as a reward for  their services and as payment for taking our letters back to the  Amazon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some hours later we saw them in single file far out upon the  plain, each with a bundle on his head, making their way back along the  path we had come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Zambo occupied our little tent at the base of the  pinnacle, and there he remained, our one link with the world below.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And now we had to decide upon our immediate movements.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We shifted our  position from among the tick-laden bushes until we came to a small  clearing thickly surrounded by trees upon all sides.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were some  flat slabs of rock in the center, with an excellent well close by, and  there we sat in cleanly comfort while we made our first plans for the  invasion of this new country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Birds were calling among the  foliage--especially one with a peculiar whooping cry which was new to  us--but beyond these sounds there were no signs of life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our first care was to make some sort of list of our own stores, so that  we might know what we had to rely upon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What with the things we had  ourselves brought up and those which Zambo had sent across on the rope,  we were fairly well supplied.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Most important of all, in view of the  dangers which might surround us, we had our four rifles and one  thousand three hundred rounds, also a shot-gun, but not more than a  hundred and fifty medium pellet cartridges.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the matter of  provisions we had enough to last for several weeks, with a sufficiency  of tobacco and a few scientific implements, including a large telescope  and a good field-glass.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All these things we collected together in the  clearing, and as a first precaution, we cut down with our hatchet and  knives a number of thorny bushes, which we piled round in a circle some  fifteen yards in diameter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This was to be our headquarters for the  time--our place of refuge against sudden danger and the guard-house for  our stores.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Fort Challenger, we called it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was midday before we had made ourselves secure, but the heat was not  oppressive, and the general character of the plateau, both in its  temperature and in its vegetation, was almost temperate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The beech,  the oak, and even the birch were to be found among the tangle of trees  which girt us in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One huge gingko tree, topping all the others, shot  its great limbs and maidenhair foliage over the fort which we had  constructed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In its shade we continued our discussion, while Lord  John, who had quickly taken command in the hour of action, gave us his  views.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"So long as neither man nor beast has seen or heard us, we are safe,"  said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"From the time they know we are here our troubles begin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are no signs that they have found us out as yet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So our game  surely is to lie low for a time and spy out the land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We want to have  a good look at our neighbors before we get on visitin' terms.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But we must advance," I ventured to remark.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"By all means, sonny my boy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We will advance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But with common sense.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We must never go so far that we can't get back to our base.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Above all,  we must never, unless it is life or death, fire off our guns.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But YOU fired yesterday," said Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, it couldn't be helped.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>However, the wind was strong and blew  outwards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is not likely that the sound could have traveled far into  the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By the way, what shall we call this place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I suppose it  is up to us to give it a name.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    There were several suggestions, more or less happy, but Challenger's  was final.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It can only have one name," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is called after the pioneer  who discovered it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is Maple White Land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Maple White Land it became, and so it is named in that chart which has  become my special task.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So it will, I trust, appear in the atlas of  the future.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The peaceful penetration of Maple White Land was the pressing subject  before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had the evidence of our own eyes that the place was  inhabited by some unknown creatures, and there was that of Maple  White's sketch-book to show that more dreadful and more dangerous  monsters might still appear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That there might also prove to be human  occupants and that they were of a malevolent character was suggested by  the skeleton impaled upon the bamboos, which could not have got there  had it not been dropped from above.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our situation, stranded without  possibility of escape in such a land, was clearly full of danger, and  our reasons endorsed every measure of caution which Lord John's  experience could suggest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yet it was surely impossible that we should  halt on the edge of this world of mystery when our very souls were  tingling with impatience to push forward and to pluck the heart from it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We therefore blocked the entrance to our zareba by filling it up with  several thorny bushes, and left our camp with the stores entirely  surrounded by this protecting hedge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We then slowly and cautiously set  forth into the unknown, following the course of the little stream which  flowed from our spring, as it should always serve us as a guide on our  return.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Hardly had we started when we came across signs that there were indeed  wonders awaiting us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After a few hundred yards of thick forest,  containing many trees which were quite unknown to me, but which  Summerlee, who was the botanist of the party, recognized as forms of  conifera and of cycadaceous plants which have long passed away in the  world below, we entered a region where the stream widened out and  formed a considerable bog.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>High reeds of a peculiar type grew thickly  before us, which were pronounced to be equisetacea, or mare's-tails,  with tree-ferns scattered amongst them, all of them swaying in a brisk  wind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly Lord John, who was walking first, halted with uplifted  hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Look at this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"By George, this must be the trail of the  father of all birds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    An enormous three-toed track was imprinted in the soft mud before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The creature, whatever it was, had crossed the swamp and had passed on  into the forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We all stopped to examine that monstrous spoor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If  it were indeed a bird--and what animal could leave such a mark.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>--its  foot was so much larger than an ostrich's that its height upon the same  scale must be enormous.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John looked eagerly round him and slipped  two cartridges into his elephant-gun.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I'll stake my good name as a shikarree," said he, "that the track is a  fresh one.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The creature has not passed ten minutes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Look how the  water is still oozing into that deeper print.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By Jove.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>See, here is  the mark of a little one.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Sure enough, smaller tracks of the same general form were running  parallel to the large ones.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But what do you make of this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried Professor Summerlee,  triumphantly, pointing to what looked like the huge print of a  five-fingered human hand appearing among the three-toed marks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Wealden.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried Challenger, in an ecstasy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I've seen them in the  Wealden clay.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is a creature walking erect upon three-toed feet, and  occasionally putting one of its five-fingered forepaws upon the ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Not a bird, my dear Roxton--not a bird.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A beast.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No; a reptile--a dinosaur.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Nothing else could have left such a track.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They puzzled a worthy Sussex doctor some ninety years ago; but who in  the world could have hoped--hoped--to have seen a sight like that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    His words died away into a whisper, and we all stood in motionless  amazement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Following the tracks, we had left the morass and passed  through a screen of brushwood and trees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Beyond was an open glade, and  in this were five of the most extraordinary creatures that I have ever  seen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Crouching down among the bushes, we observed them at our leisure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were, as I say, five of them, two being adults and three young  ones.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In size they were enormous.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even the babies were as big as  elephants, while the two large ones were far beyond all creatures I  have ever seen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They had slate-colored skin, which was scaled like a  lizard's and shimmered where the sun shone upon it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All five were  sitting up, balancing themselves upon their broad, powerful tails and  their huge three-toed hind-feet, while with their small five-fingered  front-feet they pulled down the branches upon which they browsed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I do  not know that I can bring their appearance home to you better than by  saying that they looked like monstrous kangaroos, twenty feet in  length, and with skins like black crocodiles.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I do not know how long we stayed motionless gazing at this marvelous  spectacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A strong wind blew towards us and we were well concealed,  so there was no chance of discovery.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From time to time the little ones  played round their parents in unwieldy gambols, the great beasts  bounding into the air and falling with dull thuds upon the earth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  strength of the parents seemed to be limitless, for one of them, having  some difficulty in reaching a bunch of foliage which grew upon a  considerable-sized tree, put his fore-legs round the trunk and tore it  down as if it had been a sapling.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The action seemed, as I thought, to  show not only the great development of its muscles, but also the small  one of its brain, for the whole weight came crashing down upon the top  of it, and it uttered a series of shrill yelps to show that, big as it  was, there was a limit to what it could endure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The incident made it  think, apparently, that the neighborhood was dangerous, for it slowly  lurched off through the wood, followed by its mate and its three  enormous infants.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We saw the shimmering slaty gleam of their skins  between the tree-trunks, and their heads undulating high above the  brush-wood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then they vanished from our sight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I looked at my comrades.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John was standing at gaze with his  finger on the trigger of his elephant-gun, his eager hunter's soul  shining from his fierce eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What would he not give for one such head  to place between the two crossed oars above the mantelpiece in his  snuggery at the Albany.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet his reason held him in, for all our  exploration of the wonders of this unknown land depended upon our  presence being concealed from its inhabitants.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The two professors were  in silent ecstasy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In their excitement they had unconsciously seized  each other by the hand, and stood like two little children in the  presence of a marvel, Challenger's cheeks bunched up into a seraphic  smile, and Summerlee's sardonic face softening for the moment into  wonder and reverence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Nunc dimittis.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried at last.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What will they say in England of  this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "My dear Summerlee, I will tell you with great confidence exactly what  they will say in England," said Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"They will say that you  are an infernal liar and a scientific charlatan, exactly as you and  others said of me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "In the face of photographs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Faked, Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Clumsily faked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "In the face of specimens.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Ah, there we may have them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone and his filthy Fleet Street crew  may be all yelping our praises yet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>August the twenty-eighth--the day  we saw five live iguanodons in a glade of Maple White Land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Put it  down in your diary, my young friend, and send it to your rag.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And be ready to get the toe-end of the editorial boot in return," said  Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Things look a bit different from the latitude of London,  young fellah my lad.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There's many a man who never tells his  adventures, for he can't hope to be believed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Who's to blame them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For this will seem a bit of a dream to ourselves in a month or two.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>WHAT did you say they were.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Iguanodons," said Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You'll find their footmarks all over  the Hastings sands, in Kent, and in Sussex.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The South of England was  alive with them when there was plenty of good lush green-stuff to keep  them going.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Conditions have changed, and the beasts died.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here it  seems that the conditions have not changed, and the beasts have lived.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "If ever we get out of this alive, I must have a head with me," said  Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Lord, how some of that Somaliland-Uganda crowd would turn  a beautiful pea-green if they saw it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't know what you chaps  think, but it strikes me that we are on mighty thin ice all this time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I had the same feeling of mystery and danger around us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the gloom  of the trees there seemed a constant menace and as we looked up into  their shadowy foliage vague terrors crept into one's heart.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is true  that these monstrous creatures which we had seen were lumbering,  inoffensive brutes which were unlikely to hurt anyone, but in this  world of wonders what other survivals might there not be--what fierce,  active horrors ready to pounce upon us from their lair among the rocks  or brushwood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I knew little of prehistoric life, but I had a clear  remembrance of one book which I had read in which it spoke of creatures  who would live upon our lions and tigers as a cat lives upon mice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What if these also were to be found in the woods of Maple White Land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was destined that on this very morning--our first in the new  country--we were to find out what strange hazards lay around us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  was a loathsome adventure, and one of which I hate to think.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If, as  Lord John said, the glade of the iguanodons will remain with us as a  dream, then surely the swamp of the pterodactyls will forever be our  nightmare.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let me set down exactly what occurred.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We passed very slowly through the woods, partly because Lord Roxton  acted as scout before he would let us advance, and partly because at  every second step one or other of our professors would fall, with a cry  of wonder, before some flower or insect which presented him with a new  type.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We may have traveled two or three miles in all, keeping to the  right of the line of the stream, when we came upon a considerable  opening in the trees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A belt of brushwood led up to a tangle of  rocks--the whole plateau was strewn with boulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were walking  slowly towards these rocks, among bushes which reached over our waists,  when we became aware of a strange low gabbling and whistling sound,  which filled the air with a constant clamor and appeared to come from  some spot immediately before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John held up his hand as a  signal for us to stop, and he made his way swiftly, stooping and  running, to the line of rocks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We saw him peep over them and give a  gesture of amazement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then he stood staring as if forgetting us, so  utterly entranced was he by what he saw.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally he waved us to come  on, holding up his hand as a signal for caution.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His whole bearing  made me feel that something wonderful but dangerous lay before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Creeping to his side, we looked over the rocks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The place into which  we gazed was a pit, and may, in the early days, have been one of the  smaller volcanic blow-holes of the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was bowl-shaped and at  the bottom, some hundreds of yards from where we lay, were pools of  green-scummed, stagnant water, fringed with bullrushes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a weird  place in itself, but its occupants made it seem like a scene from the  Seven Circles of Dante.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The place was a rookery of pterodactyls.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were hundreds of them congregated within view.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All the bottom  area round the water-edge was alive with their young ones, and with  hideous mothers brooding upon their leathery, yellowish eggs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From  this crawling flapping mass of obscene reptilian life came the shocking  clamor which filled the air and the mephitic, horrible, musty odor  which turned us sick.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But above, perched each upon its own stone,  tall, gray, and withered, more like dead and dried specimens than  actual living creatures, sat the horrible males, absolutely motionless  save for the rolling of their red eyes or an occasional snap of their  rat-trap beaks as a dragon-fly went past them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their huge, membranous  wings were closed by folding their fore-arms, so that they sat like  gigantic old women, wrapped in hideous web-colored shawls, and with  their ferocious heads protruding above them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Large and small, not less  than a thousand of these filthy creatures lay in the hollow before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our professors would gladly have stayed there all day, so entranced  were they by this opportunity of studying the life of a prehistoric  age.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They pointed out the fish and dead birds lying about among the  rocks as proving the nature of the food of these creatures, and I heard  them congratulating each other on having cleared up the point why the  bones of this flying dragon are found in such great numbers in certain  well-defined areas, as in the Cambridge Green-sand, since it was now  seen that, like penguins, they lived in gregarious fashion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally, however, Challenger, bent upon proving some point which  Summerlee had contested, thrust his head over the rock and nearly  brought destruction upon us all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In an instant the nearest male gave a  shrill, whistling cry, and flapped its twenty-foot span of leathery  wings as it soared up into the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The females and young ones huddled  together beside the water, while the whole circle of sentinels rose one  after the other and sailed off into the sky.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a wonderful sight  to see at least a hundred creatures of such enormous size and hideous  appearance all swooping like swallows with swift, shearing wing-strokes  above us; but soon we realized that it was not one on which we could  afford to linger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At first the great brutes flew round in a huge ring,  as if to make sure what the exact extent of the danger might be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then,  the flight grew lower and the circle narrower, until they were whizzing  round and round us, the dry, rustling flap of their huge slate-colored  wings filling the air with a volume of sound that made me think of  Hendon aerodrome upon a race day.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Make for the wood and keep together," cried Lord John, clubbing his  rifle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The brutes mean mischief.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The moment we attempted to retreat the circle closed in upon us, until  the tips of the wings of those nearest to us nearly touched our faces.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We beat at them with the stocks of our guns, but there was nothing  solid or vulnerable to strike.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then suddenly out of the whizzing,  slate-colored circle a long neck shot out, and a fierce beak made a  thrust at us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Another and another followed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee gave a cry and  put his hand to his face, from which the blood was streaming.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I felt a  prod at the back of my neck, and turned dizzy with the shock.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger fell, and as I stooped to pick him up I was again struck  from behind and dropped on the top of him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At the same instant I heard  the crash of Lord John's elephant-gun, and, looking up, saw one of the  creatures with a broken wing struggling upon the ground, spitting and  gurgling at us with a wide-opened beak and blood-shot, goggled eyes,  like some devil in a medieval picture.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Its comrades had flown higher  at the sudden sound, and were circling above our heads.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Now," cried Lord John, "now for our lives.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    We staggered through the brushwood, and even as we reached the trees  the harpies were on us again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee was knocked down, but we tore  him up and rushed among the trunks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once there we were safe, for those  huge wings had no space for their sweep beneath the branches.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As we  limped homewards, sadly mauled and discomfited, we saw them for a long  time flying at a great height against the deep blue sky above our  heads, soaring round and round, no bigger than wood-pigeons, with their  eyes no doubt still following our progress.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last, however, as we  reached the thicker woods they gave up the chase, and we saw them no  more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"A most interesting and convincing experience," said Challenger, as we  halted beside the brook and he bathed a swollen knee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We are  exceptionally well informed, Summerlee, as to the habits of the enraged  pterodactyl.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Summerlee was wiping the blood from a cut in his forehead, while I was  tying up a nasty stab in the muscle of the neck.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John had the  shoulder of his coat torn away, but the creature's teeth had only  grazed the flesh.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It is worth noting," Challenger continued, "that our young friend has  received an undoubted stab, while Lord John's coat could only have been  torn by a bite.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In my own case, I was beaten about the head by their  wings, so we have had a remarkable exhibition of their various methods  of offence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It has been touch and go for our lives," said Lord John, gravely, "and  I could not think of a more rotten sort of death than to be outed by  such filthy vermin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was sorry to fire my rifle, but, by Jove.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>there  was no great choice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We should not be here if you hadn't," said I, with conviction.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It may do no harm," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Among these woods there must be many  loud cracks from splitting or falling trees which would be just like  the sound of a gun.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But now, if you are of my opinion, we have had  thrills enough for one day, and had best get back to the surgical box  at the camp for some carbolic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Who knows what venom these beasts may  have in their hideous jaws.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    But surely no men ever had just such a day since the world began.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some  fresh surprise was ever in store for us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When, following the course of  our brook, we at last reached our glade and saw the thorny barricade of  our camp, we thought that our adventures were at an end.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But we had  something more to think of before we could rest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The gate of Fort  Challenger had been untouched, the walls were unbroken, and yet it had  been visited by some strange and powerful creature in our absence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No  foot-mark showed a trace of its nature, and only the overhanging branch  of the enormous ginko tree suggested how it might have come and gone;  but of its malevolent strength there was ample evidence in the  condition of our stores.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were strewn at random all over the  ground, and one tin of meat had been crushed into pieces so as to  extract the contents.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A case of cartridges had been shattered into  matchwood, and one of the brass shells lay shredded into pieces beside  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Again the feeling of vague horror came upon our souls, and we  gazed round with frightened eyes at the dark shadows which lay around  us, in all of which some fearsome shape might be lurking.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How good it  was when we were hailed by the voice of Zambo, and, going to the edge  of the plateau, saw him sitting grinning at us upon the top of the  opposite pinnacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"All well, Massa Challenger, all well.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Me stay here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No  fear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You always find me when you want.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    His honest black face, and the immense view before us, which carried us  half-way back to the affluent of the Amazon, helped us to remember that  we really were upon this earth in the twentieth century, and had not by  some magic been conveyed to some raw planet in its earliest and wildest  state.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How difficult it was to realize that the violet line upon the  far horizon was well advanced to that great river upon which huge  steamers ran, and folk talked of the small affairs of life, while we,  marooned among the creatures of a bygone age, could but gaze towards it  and yearn for all that it meant.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One other memory remains with me of this wonderful day, and with it I  will close this letter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The two professors, their tempers aggravated  no doubt by their injuries, had fallen out as to whether our assailants  were of the genus pterodactylus or dimorphodon, and high words had  ensued.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To avoid their wrangling I moved some little way apart, and  was seated smoking upon the trunk of a fallen tree, when Lord John  strolled over in my direction.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I say, Malone," said he, "do you remember that place where those  beasts were.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Very clearly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A sort of volcanic pit, was it not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Exactly," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Did you notice the soil.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Rocks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But round the water--where the reeds were.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It was a bluish soil.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It looked like clay.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Exactly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A volcanic tube full of blue clay.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What of that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Oh, nothing, nothing," said he, and strolled back to where the voices  of the contending men of science rose in a prolonged duet, the high,  strident note of Summerlee rising and falling to the sonorous bass of  Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I should have thought no more of Lord John's remark were  it not that once again that night I heard him mutter to himself:  "Blue  clay--clay in a volcanic tube.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" They were the last words I heard before  I dropped into an exhausted sleep.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER XI                        "For once I was the Hero"    Lord John Roxton was right when he thought that some specially toxic  quality might lie in the bite of the horrible creatures which had  attacked us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the morning after our first adventure upon the  plateau, both Summerlee and I were in great pain and fever, while  Challenger's knee was so bruised that he could hardly limp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We kept to  our camp all day, therefore, Lord John busying himself, with such help  as we could give him, in raising the height and thickness of the thorny  walls which were our only defense.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I remember that during the whole  long day I was haunted by the feeling that we were closely observed,  though by whom or whence I could give no guess.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So strong was the impression that I told Professor Challenger of it,  who put it down to the cerebral excitement caused by my fever.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Again  and again I glanced round swiftly, with the conviction that I was about  to see something, but only to meet the dark tangle of our hedge or the  solemn and cavernous gloom of the great trees which arched above our  heads.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet the feeling grew ever stronger in my own mind that  something observant and something malevolent was at our very elbow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  thought of the Indian superstition of the Curupuri--the dreadful,  lurking spirit of the woods--and I could have imagined that his  terrible presence haunted those who had invaded his most remote and  sacred retreat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That night (our third in Maple White Land) we had an experience which  left a fearful impression upon our minds, and made us thankful that  Lord John had worked so hard in making our retreat impregnable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We  were all sleeping round our dying fire when we were aroused--or,  rather, I should say, shot out of our slumbers--by a succession of the  most frightful cries and screams to which I have ever listened.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I know  no sound to which I could compare this amazing tumult, which seemed to  come from some spot within a few hundred yards of our camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was as  ear-splitting as any whistle of a railway-engine; but whereas the  whistle is a clear, mechanical, sharp-edged sound, this was far deeper  in volume and vibrant with the uttermost strain of agony and horror.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We clapped our hands to our ears to shut out that nerve-shaking appeal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A cold sweat broke out over my body, and my heart turned sick at the  misery of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All the woes of tortured life, all its stupendous  indictment of high heaven, its innumerable sorrows, seemed to be  centered and condensed into that one dreadful, agonized cry.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And then,  under this high-pitched, ringing sound there was another, more  intermittent, a low, deep-chested laugh, a growling, throaty gurgle of  merriment which formed a grotesque accompaniment to the shriek with  which it was blended.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For three or four minutes on end the fearsome  duet continued, while all the foliage rustled with the rising of  startled birds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then it shut off as suddenly as it began.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a long  time we sat in horrified silence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then Lord John threw a bundle of  twigs upon the fire, and their red glare lit up the intent faces of my  companions and flickered over the great boughs above our heads.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What was it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I whispered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We shall know in the morning," said Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It  was close to  us--not farther than the glade.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We have been privileged to overhear a prehistoric tragedy, the sort of  drama which occurred among the reeds upon the border of some Jurassic  lagoon, when the greater dragon pinned the lesser among the slime,"  said Challenger, with more solemnity than I had ever heard in his  voice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It was surely well for man that he came late in the order of  creation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were powers abroad in earlier days which no courage  and no mechanism of his could have met.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What could his sling, his  throwing-stick, or his arrow avail him against such forces as have been  loose to-night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even with a modern rifle it would be all odds on the  monster.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I think I should back my little friend," said Lord John, caressing his  Express.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But the beast would certainly have a good sporting chance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Summerlee raised his hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Hush.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Surely I hear something.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    From the utter silence there emerged a deep, regular pat-pat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  the tread of some animal--the rhythm of soft but heavy pads placed  cautiously upon the ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It stole slowly round the camp, and then  halted near our gateway.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a low, sibilant rise and fall--the  breathing of the creature.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Only our feeble hedge separated us from  this horror of the night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Each of us had seized his rifle, and Lord  John had pulled out a small bush to make an embrasure in the hedge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"By George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he whispered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I think I can see it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I stooped and peered over his shoulder through the gap.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yes, I could  see it, too.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the deep shadow of the tree there was a deeper shadow  yet, black, inchoate, vague--a crouching form full of savage vigor and  menace.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was no higher than a horse, but the dim outline suggested  vast bulk and strength.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That hissing pant, as regular and full-volumed  as the exhaust of an engine, spoke of a monstrous organism.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once, as  it moved, I thought I saw the glint of two terrible, greenish eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was an uneasy rustling, as if it were crawling slowly forward.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I believe it is going to spring.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said I, cocking my rifle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Don't fire.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't fire.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" whispered Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The crash of a gun in  this silent night would be heard for miles.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Keep it as a last card.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "If it gets over the hedge we're done," said Summerlee, and his voice  crackled into a nervous laugh as he spoke.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No, it must not get over," cried Lord John; "but hold your fire to the  last.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps I can make something of the fellow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'll chance it,  anyhow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was as brave an act as ever I saw a man do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He stooped to the fire,  picked up a blazing branch, and slipped in an instant through a  sallyport which he had made in our gateway.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The thing moved forward  with a dreadful snarl.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John never hesitated, but, running towards  it with a quick, light step, he dashed the flaming wood into the  brute's face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For one moment I had a vision of a horrible mask like a  giant toad's, of a warty, leprous skin, and of a loose mouth all  beslobbered with fresh blood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The next, there was a crash in the  underwood and our dreadful visitor was gone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I thought he wouldn't face the fire," said Lord John, laughing, as he  came back and threw his branch among the faggots.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You should not have taken such a risk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" we all cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"There was nothin' else to be done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If he had got among us we should  have shot each other in tryin' to down him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the other hand, if we  had fired through the hedge and wounded him he would soon have been on  the top of us--to say nothin' of giving ourselves away.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the whole,  I think that we are jolly well out of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What was he, then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Our learned men looked at each other with some hesitation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Personally, I am unable to classify the creature with any certainty,"  said Summerlee, lighting his pipe from the fire.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"In refusing to commit yourself you are but showing a proper scientific  reserve," said Challenger, with massive condescension.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am not  myself prepared to go farther than to say in general terms that we have  almost certainly been in contact to-night with some form of carnivorous  dinosaur.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have already expressed my anticipation that something of  the sort might exist upon this plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We have to bear in mind," remarked Summerlee, "that there are many  prehistoric forms which have never come down to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It would be rash  to suppose that we can give a name to all that we are likely to meet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Exactly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A rough classification may be the best that we can attempt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To-morrow some further evidence may help us to an identification.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Meantime we can only renew our interrupted slumbers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But not without a sentinel," said Lord John, with decision.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We can't  afford to take chances in a country like this.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Two-hour spells in the  future, for each of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then I'll just finish my pipe in starting the first one," said  Professor Summerlee; and from that time onwards we never trusted  ourselves again without a watchman.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the morning it was not long before we discovered the source of the  hideous uproar which had aroused us in the night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The iguanodon glade  was the scene of a horrible butchery.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From the pools of blood and the  enormous lumps of flesh scattered in every direction over the green  sward we imagined at first that a number of animals had been killed,  but on examining the remains more closely we discovered that all this  carnage came from one of these unwieldy monsters, which had been  literally torn to pieces by some creature not larger, perhaps, but far  more ferocious, than itself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our two professors sat in absorbed argument, examining piece after  piece, which showed the marks of savage teeth and of enormous claws.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Our judgment must still be in abeyance," said Professor Challenger,  with a huge slab of whitish-colored flesh across his knee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The  indications would be consistent with the presence of a saber-toothed  tiger, such as are still found among the breccia of our caverns; but  the creature actually seen was undoubtedly of a larger and more  reptilian character.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Personally, I should pronounce for allosaurus.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Or megalosaurus," said Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Exactly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Any one of the larger carnivorous dinosaurs would meet the  case.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Among them are to be found all the most terrible types of animal  life that have ever cursed the earth or blessed a museum.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He laughed  sonorously at his own conceit, for, though he had little sense of  humor, the crudest pleasantry from his own lips moved him always to  roars of appreciation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The less noise the better," said Lord Roxton, curtly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We don't know  who or what may be near us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If this fellah comes back for his  breakfast and catches us here we won't have so much to laugh at.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By  the way, what is this mark upon the iguanodon's hide.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    On the dull, scaly, slate-colored skin somewhere above the shoulder,  there was a singular black circle of some substance which looked like  asphalt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>None of us could suggest what it meant, though Summerlee was  of opinion that he had seen something similar upon one of the young  ones two days before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger said nothing, but looked pompous and  puffy, as if he could if he would, so that finally Lord John asked his  opinion direct.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"If your lordship will graciously permit me to open my mouth, I shall  be happy to express my sentiments," said he, with elaborate sarcasm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am not in the habit of being taken to task in the fashion which  seems to be customary with your lordship.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was not aware that it was  necessary to ask your permission before smiling at a harmless  pleasantry.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was not until he had received his apology that our touchy friend  would suffer himself to be appeased.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When at last his ruffled feelings  were at ease, he addressed us at some length from his seat upon a  fallen tree, speaking, as his habit was, as if he were imparting most  precious information to a class of a thousand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"With regard to the marking," said he, "I am inclined to agree with my  friend and colleague, Professor Summerlee, that the stains are from  asphalt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As this plateau is, in its very nature, highly volcanic, and  as asphalt is a substance which one associates with Plutonic forces, I  cannot doubt that it exists in the free liquid state, and that the  creatures may have come in contact with it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A much more important  problem is the question as to the existence of the carnivorous monster  which has left its traces in this glade.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We know roughly that this  plateau is not larger than an average English county.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Within this  confined space a certain number of creatures, mostly types which have  passed away in the world below, have lived together for innumerable  years.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, it is very clear to me that in so long a period one would  have expected that the carnivorous creatures, multiplying unchecked,  would have exhausted their food supply and have been compelled to  either modify their flesh-eating habits or die of hunger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This we see  has not been so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We can only imagine, therefore, that the balance of  Nature is preserved by some check which limits the numbers of these  ferocious creatures.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One of the many interesting problems, therefore,  which await our solution is to discover what that check may be and how  it operates.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I venture to trust that we may have some future  opportunity for the closer study of the carnivorous dinosaurs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And I venture to trust we may not," I observed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Professor only raised his great eyebrows, as the schoolmaster meets  the irrelevant observation of the naughty boy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Perhaps Professor Summerlee may have an observation to make," he said,  and the two savants ascended together into some rarefied scientific  atmosphere, where the possibilities of a modification of the birth-rate  were weighed against the decline of the food supply as a check in the  struggle for existence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That morning we mapped out a small portion of the plateau, avoiding the  swamp of the pterodactyls, and keeping to the east of our brook instead  of to the west.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In that direction the country was still thickly  wooded, with so much undergrowth that our progress was very slow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have dwelt up to now upon the terrors of Maple White Land; but there  was another side to the subject, for all that morning we wandered among  lovely flowers--mostly, as I observed, white or yellow in color, these  being, as our professors explained, the primitive flower-shades.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In  many places the ground was absolutely covered with them, and as we  walked ankle-deep on that wonderful yielding carpet, the scent was  almost intoxicating in its sweetness and intensity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The homely English  bee buzzed everywhere around us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Many of the trees under which we  passed had their branches bowed down with fruit, some of which were of  familiar sorts, while other varieties were new.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By observing which of  them were pecked by the birds we avoided all danger of poison and added  a delicious variety to our food reserve.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the jungle which we  traversed were numerous hard-trodden paths made by the wild beasts, and  in the more marshy places we saw a profusion of strange footmarks,  including many of the iguanodon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once in a grove we observed several  of these great creatures grazing, and Lord John, with his glass, was  able to report that they also were spotted with asphalt, though in a  different place to the one which we had examined in the morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What  this phenomenon meant we could not imagine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We saw many small animals, such as porcupines, a scaly ant-eater, and a  wild pig, piebald in color and with long curved tusks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once, through a  break in the trees, we saw a clear shoulder of green hill some distance  away, and across this a large dun-colored animal was traveling at a  considerable pace.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It passed so swiftly that we were unable to say  what it was; but if it were a deer, as was claimed by Lord John, it  must have been as large as those monstrous Irish elk which are still  dug up from time to time in the bogs of my native land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Ever since the mysterious visit which had been paid to our camp we  always returned to it with some misgivings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>However, on this occasion  we found everything in order.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That evening we had a grand discussion upon our present situation and  future plans, which I must describe at some length, as it led to a new  departure by which we were enabled to gain a more complete knowledge of  Maple White Land than might have come in many weeks of exploring.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  was Summerlee who opened the debate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All day he had been querulous in  manner, and now some remark of Lord John's as to what we should do on  the morrow brought all his bitterness to a head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What we ought to be doing to-day, to-morrow, and all the time," said  he, "is finding some way out of the trap into which we have fallen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You are all turning your brains towards getting into this country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  say that we should be scheming how to get out of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I am surprised, sir," boomed Challenger, stroking his majestic beard,  "that any man of science should commit himself to so ignoble a  sentiment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You are in a land which offers such an inducement to the  ambitious naturalist as none ever has since the world began, and you  suggest leaving it before we have acquired more than the most  superficial knowledge of it or of its contents.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I expected better  things of you, Professor Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You must remember," said Summerlee, sourly, "that I have a large class  in London who are at present at the mercy of an extremely inefficient  locum tenens.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This makes my situation different from yours, Professor  Challenger, since, so far as I know, you have never been entrusted with  any responsible educational work.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Quite so," said Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I have felt it to be a sacrilege to  divert a brain which is capable of the highest original research to any  lesser object.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That is why I have sternly set my face against any  proffered scholastic appointment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "For example.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" asked Summerlee, with a sneer; but Lord John hastened to  change the conversation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I must say," said he, "that I think it would be a mighty poor thing to  go back to London before I know a great deal more of this place than I  do at present.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I could never dare to walk into the back office of my paper and face  old McArdle," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>(You will excuse the frankness of this report,  will you not, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "He'd never forgive me for leaving such  unexhausted copy behind me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Besides, so far as I can see it is not  worth discussing, since we can't get down, even if we wanted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Our young friend makes up for many obvious mental lacunae by some  measure of primitive common sense," remarked Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The  interests of his deplorable profession are immaterial to us; but, as he  observes, we cannot get down in any case, so it is a waste of energy to  discuss it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is a waste of energy to do anything else," growled Summerlee from  behind his pipe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Let me remind you that we came here upon a perfectly  definite mission, entrusted to us at the meeting of the Zoological  Institute in London.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That mission was to test the truth of Professor  Challenger's statements.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Those statements, as I am bound to admit, we  are now in a position to endorse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our ostensible work is therefore  done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to the detail which remains to be worked out upon this  plateau, it is so enormous that only a large expedition, with a very  special equipment, could hope to cope with it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Should we attempt to do  so ourselves, the only possible result must be that we shall never  return with the important contribution to science which we have already  gained.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger has devised means for getting us on to  this plateau when it appeared to be inaccessible; I think that we  should now call upon him to use the same ingenuity in getting us back  to the world from which we came.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I confess that as Summerlee stated his view it struck me as altogether  reasonable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even Challenger was affected by the consideration that his  enemies would never stand confuted if the confirmation of his  statements should never reach those who had doubted them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The problem of the descent is at first sight a formidable one," said  he, "and yet I cannot doubt that the intellect can solve it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am  prepared to agree with our colleague that a protracted stay in Maple  White Land is at present inadvisable, and that the question of our  return will soon have to be faced.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I absolutely refuse to leave,  however, until we have made at least a superficial examination of this  country, and are able to take back with us something in the nature of a  chart.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Professor Summerlee gave a snort of impatience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We have spent two long days in exploration," said he, "and we are no  wiser as to the actual geography of the place than when we started.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  is clear that it is all thickly wooded, and it would take months to  penetrate it and to learn the relations of one part to another.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If  there were some central peak it would be different, but it all slopes  downwards, so far as we can see.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The farther we go the less likely it  is that we will get any general view.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was at that moment that I had my inspiration.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My eyes chanced to  light upon the enormous gnarled trunk of the gingko tree which cast its  huge branches over us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Surely, if its bole exceeded that of all  others, its height must do the same.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If the rim of the plateau was  indeed the highest point, then why should this mighty tree not prove to  be a watchtower which commanded the whole country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, ever since I  ran wild as a lad in Ireland I have been a bold and skilled  tree-climber.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My comrades might be my masters on the rocks, but I knew  that I would be supreme among those branches.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Could I only get my legs  on to the lowest of the giant off-shoots, then it would be strange  indeed if I could not make my way to the top.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My comrades were  delighted at my idea.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Our young friend," said Challenger, bunching up the red apples of his  cheeks, "is capable of acrobatic exertions which would be impossible to  a man of a more solid, though possibly of a more commanding,  appearance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I applaud his resolution.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "By George, young fellah, you've put your hand on it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said Lord John,  clapping me on the back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"How we never came to think of it before I  can't imagine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There's not more than an hour of daylight left, but if  you take your notebook you may be able to get some rough sketch of the  place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If we put these three ammunition cases under the branch, I will  soon hoist you on to it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He stood on the boxes while I faced the trunk, and was gently raising  me when Challenger sprang forward and gave me such a thrust with his  huge hand that he fairly shot me into the tree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With both arms  clasping the branch, I scrambled  hard with my feet until I had worked,  first my body, and then my knees, onto it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were three excellent  off-shoots, like huge rungs of a ladder, above my head, and a tangle of  convenient branches beyond, so that I clambered onwards with such speed  that I soon lost sight of the ground and had nothing but foliage  beneath me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now and then I encountered a check, and once I had to shin  up a creeper for eight or ten feet, but I made excellent progress, and  the booming of Challenger's voice seemed to be a great distance beneath  me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The tree was, however, enormous, and, looking upwards, I could see  no thinning of the leaves above my head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was some thick,  bush-like clump which seemed to be a parasite upon a branch up which I  was swarming.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I leaned my head round it in order to see what was  beyond, and I nearly fell out of the tree in my surprise and horror at  what I saw.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A face was gazing into mine--at the distance of only a foot or two.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The creature that owned it had been crouching behind the parasite, and  had looked round it at the same instant that I did.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a human  face--or at least it was far more human than any monkey's that I have  ever seen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was long, whitish, and blotched with pimples, the nose  flattened, and the lower jaw projecting, with a bristle of coarse  whiskers round the chin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The eyes, which were under thick and heavy  brows, were bestial and ferocious, and as it opened its mouth to snarl  what sounded like a curse at me I observed that it had curved, sharp  canine teeth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For an instant I read hatred and menace in the evil  eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, as quick as a flash, came an expression of overpowering  fear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a crash of broken boughs as it dived wildly down into  the tangle of green.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I caught a glimpse of a hairy body like that of a  reddish pig, and then it was gone amid a swirl of leaves and branches.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What's the matter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" shouted Roxton from below.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Anything wrong with  you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Did you see it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried, with my arms round the branch and all my  nerves tingling.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We heard a row, as if your foot had slipped.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What was it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I was so shocked at the sudden and strange appearance of this ape-man  that I hesitated whether I should not climb down again and tell my  experience to my companions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I was already so far up the great  tree that it seemed a humiliation to return without having carried out  my mission.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After a long pause, therefore, to recover my breath and my courage, I  continued my ascent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once I put my weight upon a rotten branch and  swung for a few seconds by my hands, but in the main it was all easy  climbing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Gradually the leaves thinned around me, and I was aware,  from the wind upon my face, that I had topped all the trees of the  forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was determined, however, not to look about me before I had  reached the very highest point, so I scrambled on until I had got so  far that the topmost branch was bending beneath my weight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There I  settled into a convenient fork, and, balancing myself securely, I found  myself looking down at a most wonderful panorama of this strange  country in which we found ourselves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The sun was just above the western sky-line, and the evening was a  particularly bright and clear one, so that the whole extent of the  plateau was visible beneath me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was, as seen from this height, of  an oval contour, with a breadth of about thirty miles and a width of  twenty.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Its general shape was that of a shallow funnel, all the sides  sloping down to a considerable lake in the center.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This lake may have  been ten miles in circumference, and lay very green and beautiful in  the evening light, with a thick fringe of reeds at its edges, and with  its surface broken by several yellow sandbanks, which gleamed golden in  the mellow sunshine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A number of long dark objects, which were too  large for alligators and too long for canoes, lay upon the edges of  these patches of sand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With my glass I could clearly see that they  were alive, but what their nature might be I could not imagine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From the side of the plateau on which we were, slopes of woodland, with  occasional glades, stretched down for five or six miles to the central  lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could see at my very feet the glade of the iguanodons, and  farther off was a round opening in the trees which marked the swamp of  the pterodactyls.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the side facing me, however, the plateau  presented a very different aspect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There the basalt cliffs of the  outside were reproduced upon the inside, forming an escarpment about  two hundred feet high, with a woody slope beneath it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Along the base  of these red cliffs, some distance above the ground, I could see a  number of dark holes through the glass, which I conjectured to be the  mouths of caves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At the opening of one of these something white was  shimmering, but I was unable to make out what it was.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I sat charting  the country until the sun had set and it was so dark that I could no  longer distinguish details.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then I climbed down to my companions  waiting for me so eagerly at the bottom of the great tree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For once I  was the hero of the expedition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Alone I had thought of it, and alone I  had done it; and here was the chart which would save us a month's blind  groping among unknown dangers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Each of them shook me solemnly by the  hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But before they discussed the details of my map I had to tell them of  my encounter with the ape-man among the branches.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"He has been there all the time," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"How do you know that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" asked Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Because I have never been without that feeling that something  malevolent was watching us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I mentioned it to you, Professor  Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Our young friend certainly said something of the kind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He is also the  one among us who is endowed with that Celtic temperament which would  make him sensitive to such impressions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "The whole theory of telepathy----" began Summerlee, filling his pipe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Is too vast to be now discussed," said Challenger, with decision.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Tell me, now," he added, with the air of a bishop addressing a  Sunday-school, "did you happen to observe whether the creature could  cross its thumb over its palm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No, indeed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Had it a tail.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Was the foot prehensile.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I do not think it could have made off so fast among the branches if it  could not get a grip with its feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "In South America there are, if my memory serves me--you will check the  observation, Professor Summerlee--some thirty-six species of monkeys,  but the anthropoid ape is unknown.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is clear, however, that he  exists in this country, and that he is not the hairy, gorilla-like  variety, which is never seen out of Africa or the East.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (I was  inclined to interpolate, as I looked at him, that I had seen his first  cousin in Kensington.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "This is a whiskered and colorless type, the  latter characteristic pointing to the fact that he spends his days in  arboreal seclusion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The question which we have to face is whether he  approaches more closely to the ape or the man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the latter case, he  may well approximate to what the vulgar have called the 'missing link.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'  The solution of this problem is our immediate duty.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is nothing of the sort," said Summerlee, abruptly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Now that,  through the intelligence and activity of Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone" (I cannot help  quoting the words), "we have got our chart, our one and only immediate  duty is to get ourselves safe and sound out of this awful place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "The flesh-pots of civilization," groaned Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The ink-pots of civilization, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is our task to put on record  what we have seen, and to leave the further exploration to others.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You  all agreed as much before Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone got us the chart.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well," said Challenger, "I admit that my mind will be more at ease  when I am assured that the result of our expedition has been conveyed  to our friends.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How we are to get down from this place I have not as  yet an idea.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have never yet encountered any problem, however, which  my inventive brain was unable to solve, and I promise you that  to-morrow I will turn my attention to the question of our descent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  And so the matter was allowed to rest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But that evening, by the light of the fire and of a single candle, the  first map of the lost world was elaborated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Every detail which I had  roughly noted from my watch-tower was drawn out in its relative place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger's pencil hovered over the great blank which marked the lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What shall we call it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Why should you not take the chance of perpetuating your own name.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  said Summerlee, with his usual touch of acidity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I trust, sir, that my name will have other and more personal claims  upon posterity," said Challenger, severely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Any ignoramus can hand  down his worthless memory by imposing it upon a mountain or a river.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  need no such monument.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Summerlee, with a twisted smile, was about to make some fresh assault  when Lord John hastened to intervene.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's up to you, young fellah, to name the lake," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You saw it  first, and, by George, if you choose to put 'Lake Malone' on it, no one  has a better right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "By all means.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let our young friend give it a name," said Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Then," said I, blushing, I dare say, as I said it, "let it be named  Lake Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Don't you think the Central Lake would be more descriptive.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" remarked  Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I should prefer Lake Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Challenger looked at me sympathetically, and shook his great head in  mock disapproval.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Boys will be boys," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Lake Gladys let it  be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"                                     CHAPTER XII                    "It was Dreadful in the Forest"    I have said--or perhaps I have not said, for my memory plays me sad  tricks these days--that I glowed with pride when three such men as my  comrades thanked me for having saved, or at least greatly helped, the  situation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As the youngster of the party, not merely in years, but in  experience, character, knowledge, and all that goes to make a man, I  had been overshadowed from the first.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And now I was coming into my  own.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I warmed at the thought.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Alas.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>for the pride which goes before a  fall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That little glow of self-satisfaction, that added measure of  self-confidence, were to lead me on that very night to the most  dreadful experience of my life, ending with a shock which turns my  heart sick when I think of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It came about in this way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had been unduly excited by the adventure  of the tree, and sleep seemed to be impossible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee was on  guard, sitting hunched over our small fire, a quaint, angular figure,  his rifle across his knees and his pointed, goat-like beard wagging  with each weary nod of his head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John lay silent, wrapped in the  South American poncho which he wore, while Challenger snored with a  roll and rattle which reverberated through the woods.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The full moon  was shining brightly, and the air was crisply cold.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What a night for a  walk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And then suddenly came the thought, "Why not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  Suppose I stole  softly away, suppose I made my way down to the central lake, suppose I  was back at breakfast with some record of the place--would I not in  that case be thought an even more worthy associate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, if Summerlee  carried the day and some means of escape were found, we should return  to London with first-hand knowledge of the central mystery of the  plateau, to which I alone, of all men, would have penetrated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I thought  of Gladys, with her "There are heroisms all round us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  I seemed to hear  her voice as she said it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I thought also of McArdle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What a three  column article for the paper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What a foundation for a career.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A  correspondentship in the next great war might be within my reach.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  clutched at a gun--my pockets were full of cartridges--and, parting the  thorn bushes at the gate of our zareba, quickly slipped out.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My last  glance showed me the unconscious Summerlee, most futile of sentinels,  still nodding away like a queer mechanical toy in front of the  smouldering fire.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had not gone a hundred yards before I deeply repented my rashness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  may have said somewhere in this chronicle that I am too imaginative to  be a really courageous man, but that I have an overpowering fear of  seeming afraid.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This was the power which now carried me onwards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  simply could not slink back with nothing done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even if my comrades  should not have missed me, and should never know of my weakness, there  would still remain some intolerable self-shame in my own soul.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet  I shuddered at the position in which I found myself, and would have  given all I possessed at that moment to have been honorably free of the  whole business.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was dreadful in the forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The trees grew so thickly and their  foliage spread so widely that I could see nothing of the moon-light  save that here and there the high branches made a tangled filigree  against the starry sky.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As the eyes became more used to the obscurity  one learned that there were different degrees of darkness among the  trees--that some were dimly visible, while between and among them there  were coal-black shadowed patches, like the mouths of caves, from which  I shrank in horror as I passed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I thought of the despairing yell of  the tortured iguanodon--that dreadful cry which had echoed through the  woods.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I thought, too, of the glimpse I had in the light of Lord  John's torch of that bloated, warty, blood-slavering muzzle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even now  I was on its hunting-ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At any instant it might spring upon me  from the shadows--this nameless and horrible monster.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I stopped, and,  picking a cartridge from my pocket, I opened the breech of my gun.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As  I touched the lever my heart leaped within me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the shot-gun,  not the rifle, which I had taken.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Again the impulse to return swept over me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here, surely, was a most  excellent reason for my failure--one for which no one would think the  less of me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But again the foolish pride fought against that very word.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could not--must not--fail.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After all, my rifle would probably have  been as useless as a shot-gun against such dangers as I might meet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If  I were to go back to camp to change my weapon I could hardly expect to  enter and to leave again without being seen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In that case there would  be explanations, and my attempt would no longer be all my own.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After a  little hesitation, then, I screwed up my courage and continued upon my  way, my useless gun under my arm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The darkness of the forest had been alarming, but even worse was the  white, still flood of moonlight in the open glade of the iguanodons.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Hid among the bushes, I looked out at it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>None of the great brutes  were in sight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps the tragedy which had befallen one of them had  driven them from their feeding-ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the misty, silvery night I  could see no sign of any living thing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Taking courage, therefore, I  slipped rapidly across it, and among the jungle on the farther side I  picked up once again the brook which was my guide.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a cheery  companion, gurgling and chuckling as it ran, like the dear old  trout-stream in the West Country where I have fished at night in my  boyhood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So long as I followed it down I must come to the lake, and so  long as I followed it back I must come to the camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Often I had to  lose sight of it on account of the tangled brush-wood, but I was always  within earshot of its tinkle and splash.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As one descended the slope the woods became thinner, and bushes, with  occasional high trees, took the place of the forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could make good  progress, therefore, and I could see without being seen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I passed  close to the pterodactyl swamp, and as I did so, with a dry, crisp,  leathery rattle of wings, one of these great creatures--it was twenty  feet at least from tip to tip--rose up from somewhere near me and  soared into the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As it passed across the face of the moon the  light shone clearly through the membranous wings, and it looked like a  flying skeleton against the white, tropical radiance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I crouched low  among the bushes, for I knew from past experience that with a single  cry the creature could bring a hundred of its loathsome mates about my  ears.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was not until it had settled again that I dared to steal  onwards upon my journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The night had been exceedingly still, but as I advanced I became  conscious of a low, rumbling sound, a continuous murmur, somewhere in  front of me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This grew louder as I proceeded, until at last it was  clearly quite close to me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I stood still the sound was constant,  so that it seemed to come from some stationary cause.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was like a  boiling kettle or the bubbling of some great pot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Soon I came upon the  source of it, for in the center of a small clearing I found a lake--or  a pool, rather, for it was not larger than the basin of the Trafalgar  Square fountain--of some black, pitch-like stuff, the surface of which  rose and fell in great blisters of bursting gas.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The air above it was  shimmering with heat, and the ground round was so hot that I could  hardly bear to lay my hand on it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was clear that the great volcanic  outburst which had raised this strange plateau so many years ago had  not yet entirely spent its forces.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Blackened rocks and mounds of lava  I had already seen everywhere peeping out from amid the luxuriant  vegetation which draped them, but this asphalt pool in the jungle was  the first sign that we had of actual existing activity on the slopes of  the ancient crater.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had no time to examine it further for I had need  to hurry if I were to be back in camp in the morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a fearsome walk, and one which will be with me so long as memory  holds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the great moonlight clearings I slunk along among the  shadows on the margin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the jungle I crept forward, stopping with a  beating heart whenever I heard, as I often did, the crash of breaking  branches as some wild beast went past.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now and then great shadows  loomed up for an instant and were gone--great, silent shadows which  seemed to prowl upon padded feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How often I stopped with the  intention of returning, and yet every time my pride conquered my fear,  and sent me on again until my object should be attained.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last (my watch showed that it was one in the morning) I saw the  gleam of water amid the openings of the jungle, and ten minutes later I  was among the reeds upon the borders of the central lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was  exceedingly dry, so I lay down and took a long draught of its waters,  which were fresh and cold.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a broad pathway with many tracks  upon it at the spot which I had found, so that it was clearly one of  the drinking-places of the animals.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Close to the water's edge there  was a huge isolated block of lava.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Up this I climbed, and, lying on  the top, I had an excellent view in every direction.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The first thing which I saw filled me with amazement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I described  the view from the summit of the great tree, I said that on the farther  cliff I could see a number of dark spots, which appeared to be the  mouths of caves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, as I looked up at the same cliffs, I saw discs  of light in every direction, ruddy, clearly-defined patches, like the  port-holes of a liner in the darkness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment I thought it was  the lava-glow from some volcanic action; but this could not be so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Any  volcanic action would surely be down in the hollow and not high among  the rocks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What, then, was the alternative.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was wonderful, and yet  it must surely be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These ruddy spots must be the reflection of fires  within the caves--fires which could only be lit by the hand of man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were human beings, then, upon the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How gloriously my  expedition was justified.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here was news indeed for us to bear back  with us to London.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a long time I lay and watched these red, quivering blotches of  light.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I suppose they were ten miles off from me, yet even at that  distance one could observe how, from time to time, they twinkled or  were obscured as someone passed before them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What would I not have  given to be able to crawl up to them, to peep in, and to take back some  word to my comrades as to the appearance and character of the race who  lived in so strange a place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was out of the question for the  moment, and yet surely we could not leave the plateau until we had some  definite knowledge upon the point.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lake Gladys--my own lake--lay like a sheet of quicksilver before me,  with a reflected moon shining brightly in the center of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  shallow, for in many places I saw low sandbanks protruding above the  water.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Everywhere upon the still surface I could see signs of life,  sometimes mere rings and ripples in the water, sometimes the gleam of a  great silver-sided fish in the air, sometimes the arched, slate-colored  back of some passing monster.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once upon a yellow sandbank I saw a  creature like a huge swan, with a clumsy body and a high, flexible  neck, shuffling about upon the margin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Presently it plunged in, and  for some time I could see the arched neck and darting head undulating  over the water.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then it dived, and I saw it no more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My attention was soon drawn away from these distant sights and brought  back to what was going on at my very feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Two creatures like large  armadillos had come down to the drinking-place, and were squatting at  the edge of the water, their long, flexible tongues like red ribbons  shooting in and out as they lapped.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A huge deer, with branching horns,  a magnificent creature which carried itself like a king, came down with  its doe and two fawns and drank beside the armadillos.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No such deer  exist anywhere else upon earth, for the moose or elks which I have seen  would hardly have reached its shoulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Presently it gave a warning  snort, and was off with its family among the reeds, while the  armadillos also scuttled for shelter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A new-comer, a most monstrous  animal, was coming down the path.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment I wondered where I could have seen that ungainly shape,  that arched back with triangular fringes along it, that strange  bird-like head held close to the ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then it came back, to me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  was the stegosaurus--the very creature which Maple White had preserved  in his sketch-book, and which had been the first object which arrested  the attention of Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There he was--perhaps the very specimen  which the American artist had encountered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The ground shook beneath  his tremendous weight, and his gulpings of water resounded through the  still night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For five minutes he was so close to my rock that by  stretching out my hand I could have touched the hideous waving hackles  upon his back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then he lumbered away and was lost among the boulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Looking at my watch, I saw that it was half-past two o'clock, and high  time, therefore, that I started upon my homeward journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was no  difficulty about the direction in which I should return for all along I  had kept the little brook upon my left, and it opened into the central  lake within a stone's-throw of the boulder upon which I had been lying.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I set off, therefore, in high spirits, for I felt that I had done good  work and was bringing back a fine budget of news for my companions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Foremost of all, of course, were the sight of the fiery caves and the  certainty that some troglodytic race inhabited them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But besides that  I could speak from experience of the central lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could testify  that it was full of strange creatures, and I had seen several land  forms of primeval life which we had not before encountered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  reflected as I walked that few men in the world could have spent a  stranger night or added more to human knowledge in the course of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was plodding up the slope, turning these thoughts over in my mind,  and had reached a point which may have been half-way to home, when my  mind was brought back to my own position by a strange noise behind me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was something between a snore and a growl, low, deep, and  exceedingly menacing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some strange creature was evidently near me, but  nothing could be seen, so I hastened more rapidly upon my way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had  traversed half a mile or so when suddenly the sound was repeated, still  behind me, but louder and more menacing than before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My heart stood  still within me as it flashed across me that the beast, whatever it  was, must surely be after ME.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My skin grew cold and my hair rose at  the thought.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That these monsters should tear each other to pieces was  a part of the strange struggle for existence, but that they should turn  upon modern man, that they should deliberately track and hunt down the  predominant human, was a staggering and fearsome thought.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I remembered  again the blood-beslobbered face which we had seen in the glare of Lord  John's torch, like some horrible vision from the deepest circle of  Dante's hell.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With my knees shaking beneath me, I stood and glared  with starting eyes down the moonlit path which lay behind me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All was  quiet as in a dream landscape.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Silver clearings and the black patches  of the bushes--nothing else could I see.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then from out of the silence,  imminent and threatening, there came once more that low, throaty  croaking, far louder and closer than before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There could no longer be  a doubt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Something was on my trail, and was closing in upon me every  minute.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I stood like a man paralyzed, still staring at the ground which I had  traversed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then suddenly I saw it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was movement among the  bushes at the far end of the clearing which I had just traversed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A  great dark shadow disengaged itself and hopped out into the clear  moonlight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I say "hopped" advisedly, for the beast moved like a  kangaroo, springing along in an erect position upon its powerful hind  legs, while its front ones were held bent in front of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was of  enormous size and power, like an erect elephant, but its movements, in  spite of its bulk, were exceedingly alert.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment, as I saw its  shape, I hoped that it was an iguanodon, which I knew to be harmless,  but, ignorant as I was, I soon saw that this was a very different  creature.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Instead of the gentle, deer-shaped head of the great  three-toed leaf-eater, this beast had a broad, squat, toad-like face  like that which had alarmed us in our camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His ferocious cry and the  horrible energy of his pursuit both assured me that this was surely one  of the great flesh-eating dinosaurs, the most terrible beasts which  have ever walked this earth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As the huge brute loped along it dropped  forward upon its fore-paws and brought its nose to the ground every  twenty yards or so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was smelling out my trail.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sometimes, for an  instant, it was at fault.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then it would catch it up again and come  bounding swiftly along the path I had taken.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even now when I think of that nightmare the sweat breaks out upon my  brow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What could I do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My useless fowling-piece was in my hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What  help could I get from that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I looked desperately round for some rock  or tree, but I was in a bushy jungle with nothing higher than a sapling  within sight, while I knew that the creature behind me could tear down  an ordinary tree as though it were a reed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My only possible chance lay  in flight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could not move swiftly over the rough, broken ground, but  as I looked round me in despair I saw a well-marked, hard-beaten path  which ran across in front of me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had seen several of the sort, the  runs of various wild beasts, during our expeditions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Along this I  could perhaps hold my own, for I was a fast runner, and in excellent  condition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Flinging away my useless gun, I set myself to do such a  half-mile as I have never done before or since.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My limbs ached, my  chest heaved, I felt that my throat would burst for want of air, and  yet with that horror behind me I ran and I ran and ran.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last I  paused, hardly able to move.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment I thought that I had thrown  him off.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The path lay still behind me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And then suddenly, with a  crashing and a rending, a thudding of giant feet and a panting of  monster lungs the beast was upon me once more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was at my very  heels.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was lost.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Madman that I was to linger so long before I fled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Up to then he had  hunted by scent, and his movement was slow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But he had actually seen  me as I started to run.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From then onwards he had hunted by sight, for  the path showed him where I had gone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, as he came round the curve,  he was springing in great bounds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The moonlight shone upon his huge  projecting eyes, the row of enormous teeth in his open mouth, and the  gleaming fringe of claws upon his short, powerful forearms.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With a  scream of terror I turned and rushed wildly down the path.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behind me  the thick, gasping breathing of the creature sounded louder and louder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His heavy footfall was beside me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Every instant I expected to feel his  grip upon my back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And then suddenly there came a crash--I was falling  through space, and everything beyond was darkness and rest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I emerged from my unconsciousness--which could not, I think, have  lasted more than a few minutes--I was aware of a most dreadful and  penetrating smell.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Putting out my hand in the darkness I came upon  something which felt like a huge lump of meat, while my other hand  closed upon a large bone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Up above me there was a circle of starlit  sky, which showed me that I was lying at the bottom of a deep pit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Slowly I staggered to my feet and felt myself all over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was stiff  and sore from head to foot, but there was no limb which would not move,  no joint which would not bend.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As the circumstances of my fall came  back into my confused brain, I looked up in terror, expecting to see  that dreadful head silhouetted against the paling sky.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was no  sign of the monster, however, nor could I hear any sound from above.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  began to walk slowly round, therefore, feeling in every direction to  find out what this strange place could be into which I had been so  opportunely precipitated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was, as I have said, a pit, with sharply-sloping walls and a level  bottom about twenty feet across.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This bottom was littered with great  gobbets of flesh, most of which was in the last state of putridity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The atmosphere was poisonous and horrible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After tripping and  stumbling over these lumps of decay, I came suddenly against something  hard, and I found that an upright post was firmly fixed in the center  of the hollow.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was so high that I could not reach the top of it  with my hand, and it appeared to be covered with grease.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly I remembered that I had a tin box of wax-vestas in my pocket.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Striking one of them, I was able at last to form some opinion of this  place into which I had fallen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There could be no question as to its  nature.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a trap--made by the hand of man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The post in the  center, some nine feet long, was sharpened at the upper end, and was  black with the stale blood of the creatures who had been impaled upon  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The remains scattered about were fragments of the victims, which  had been cut away in order to clear the stake for the next who might  blunder in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I remembered that Challenger had declared that man could  not exist upon the plateau, since with his feeble weapons he could not  hold his own against the monsters who roamed over it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But now it was  clear enough how it could be done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In their narrow-mouthed caves the  natives, whoever they might be, had refuges into which the huge  saurians could not penetrate, while with their developed brains they  were capable of setting such traps, covered with branches, across the  paths which marked the run of the animals as would destroy them in  spite of all their strength and activity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Man was always the master.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The sloping wall of the pit was not difficult for an active man to  climb, but I hesitated long before I trusted myself within reach of the  dreadful creature which had so nearly destroyed me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How did I know  that he was not lurking in the nearest clump of bushes, waiting for my  reappearance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I took heart, however, as I recalled a conversation  between Challenger and Summerlee upon the habits of the great saurians.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Both were agreed that the monsters were practically brainless, that  there was no room for reason in their tiny cranial cavities, and that  if they have disappeared from the rest of the world it was assuredly on  account of their own stupidity, which made it impossible for them to  adapt themselves to changing conditions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To lie in wait for me now would mean that the creature had appreciated  what had happened to me, and this in turn would argue some power  connecting cause and effect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Surely it was more likely that a  brainless creature, acting solely by vague predatory instinct, would  give up the chase when I disappeared, and, after a pause of  astonishment, would wander away in search of some other prey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  clambered to the edge of the pit and looked over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The stars were  fading, the sky was whitening, and the cold wind of morning blew  pleasantly upon my face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could see or hear nothing of my enemy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Slowly I climbed out and sat for a while upon the ground, ready to  spring back into my refuge if any danger should appear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then,  reassured by the absolute stillness and by the growing light, I took my  courage in both hands and stole back along the path which I had come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some distance down it I picked up my gun, and shortly afterwards struck  the brook which was my guide.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So, with many a frightened backward  glance, I made for home.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And suddenly there came something to remind me of my absent companions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the clear, still morning air there sounded far away the sharp, hard  note of a single rifle-shot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I paused and listened, but there was  nothing more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment I was shocked at the thought that some  sudden danger might have befallen them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But then a simpler and more  natural explanation came to my mind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was now broad daylight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No  doubt my absence had been noticed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They had imagined, that I was lost  in the woods, and had fired this shot to guide me home.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is true  that we had made a strict resolution against firing, but if it seemed  to them that I might be in danger they would not hesitate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was for  me now to hurry on as fast as possible, and so to reassure them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was weary and spent, so my progress was not so fast as I wished; but  at last I came into regions which I knew.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was the swamp of the  pterodactyls upon my left; there in front of me was the glade of the  iguanodons.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now I was in the last belt of trees which separated me  from Fort Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I raised my voice in a cheery shout to allay  their fears.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No answering greeting came back to me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My heart sank at  that ominous stillness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I quickened my pace into a run.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The zareba  rose before me, even as I had left it, but the gate was open.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I rushed  in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the cold, morning light it was a fearful sight which met my  eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our effects were scattered in wild confusion over the ground; my  comrades had disappeared, and close to the smouldering ashes of our  fire the grass was stained crimson with a hideous pool of blood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was so stunned by this sudden shock that for a time I must have  nearly lost my reason.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have a vague recollection, as one remembers a  bad dream, of rushing about through the woods all round the empty camp,  calling wildly for my companions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No answer came back from the silent  shadows.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The horrible thought that I might never see them again, that  I might find myself abandoned all alone in that dreadful place, with no  possible way of descending into the world below, that I might live and  die in that nightmare country, drove me to desperation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could have  torn my hair and beaten my head in my despair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Only now did I realize  how I had learned to lean upon my companions, upon the serene  self-confidence of Challenger, and upon the masterful, humorous  coolness of Lord John Roxton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Without them I was like a child in the  dark, helpless and powerless.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I did not know which way to turn or what  I should do first.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After a period, during which I sat in bewilderment, I set myself to try  and discover what sudden misfortune could have befallen my companions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The whole disordered appearance of the camp showed that there had been  some sort of attack, and the rifle-shot no doubt marked the time when  it had occurred.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That there should have been only one shot showed that  it had been all over in an instant.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The rifles still lay upon the  ground, and one of them--Lord John's--had the empty cartridge in the  breech.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The blankets of Challenger and of Summerlee beside the fire  suggested that they had been asleep at the time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The cases of  ammunition and of food were scattered about in a wild litter, together  with our unfortunate cameras and plate-carriers, but none of them were  missing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the other hand, all the exposed provisions--and I  remembered that there were a considerable quantity of them--were gone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were animals, then, and not natives, who had made the inroad, for  surely the latter would have left nothing behind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But if animals, or some single terrible animal, then what had become of  my comrades.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A ferocious beast would surely have destroyed them and  left their remains.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is true that there was that one hideous pool of  blood, which told of violence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such a monster as had pursued me during  the night could have carried away a victim as easily as a cat would a  mouse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In that case the others would have followed in pursuit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But  then they would assuredly have taken their rifles with them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The more  I tried to think it out with my confused and weary brain the less could  I find any plausible explanation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I searched round in the forest, but  could see no tracks which could help me to a conclusion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once I lost  myself, and it was only by good luck, and after an hour of wandering,  that I found the camp once more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly a thought came to me and brought some little comfort to my  heart.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was not absolutely alone in the world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Down at the bottom of  the cliff, and within call of me, was waiting the faithful Zambo.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  went to the edge of the plateau and looked over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sure enough, he was  squatting among his blankets beside his fire in his little camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But,  to my amazement, a second man was seated in front of him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For an  instant my heart leaped for joy, as I thought that one of my comrades  had made his way safely down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But a second glance dispelled the hope.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The rising sun shone red upon the man's skin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was an Indian.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  shouted loudly and waved my handkerchief.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Presently Zambo looked up,  waved his hand, and turned to ascend the pinnacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a short time he  was standing close to me and listening with deep distress to the story  which I told him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Devil got them for sure, Massa Malone," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You got into the  devil's country, sah, and he take you all to himself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You take advice,  Massa Malone, and come down quick, else he get you as well.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "How can I come down, Zambo.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You get creepers from trees, Massa Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Throw them over here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  make fast to this stump, and so you have bridge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We have thought of that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are no creepers here which could bear  us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Send for ropes, Massa Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Who can I send, and where.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Send to Indian villages, sah.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Plenty hide rope in Indian village.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Indian down below; send him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Who is he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"One of our Indians.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Other ones beat him and take away his pay.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He  come back to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Ready now to take letter, bring rope,--anything.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    To take a letter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps he might bring help; but in any  case he would ensure that our lives were not spent for nothing, and  that news of all that we had won for Science should reach our friends  at home.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had two completed letters already waiting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I would spend  the day in writing a third, which would bring my experiences absolutely  up to date.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Indian could bear this back to the world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I ordered  Zambo, therefore, to come again in the evening, and I spent my  miserable and lonely day in recording my own adventures of the night  before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I also drew up a note, to be given to any white merchant or  captain of a steam-boat whom the Indian could find, imploring them to  see that ropes were sent to us, since our lives must depend upon it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These documents I threw to Zambo in the evening, and also my purse,  which contained three English sovereigns.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These were to be given to  the Indian, and he was promised twice as much if he returned with the  ropes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So now you will understand, my dear Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>McArdle, how this communication  reaches you, and you will also know the truth, in case you never hear  again from your unfortunate correspondent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To-night I am too weary and  too depressed to make my plans.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To-morrow I must think out some way by  which I shall keep in touch with this camp, and yet search round for  any traces of my unhappy friends.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER XIII                   "A Sight which I shall Never Forget"    Just as the sun was setting upon that melancholy night I saw the lonely  figure of the Indian upon the vast plain beneath me, and I watched him,  our one faint hope of salvation, until he disappeared in the rising  mists of evening which lay, rose-tinted from the setting sun, between  the far-off river and me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was quite dark when I at last turned back to our stricken camp, and  my last vision as I went was the red gleam of Zambo's fire, the one  point of light in the wide world below, as was his faithful presence in  my own shadowed soul.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet I felt happier than I had done since  this crushing blow had fallen upon me, for it was good to think that  the world should know what we had done, so that at the worst our names  should not perish with our bodies, but should go down to posterity  associated with the result of our labors.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was an awesome thing to sleep in that ill-fated camp; and yet it was  even more unnerving to do so in the jungle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One or the other it must  be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Prudence, on the one hand, warned me that I should remain on  guard, but exhausted Nature, on the other, declared that I should do  nothing of the kind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I climbed up on to a limb of the great gingko  tree, but there was no secure perch on its rounded surface, and I  should certainly have fallen off and broken my neck the moment I began  to doze.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I got down, therefore, and pondered over what I should do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally, I closed the door of the zareba, lit three separate fires in a  triangle, and having eaten a hearty supper dropped off into a profound  sleep, from which I had a strange and most welcome awakening.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the  early morning, just as day was breaking, a hand was laid upon my arm,  and starting up, with all my nerves in a tingle and my hand feeling for  a rifle, I gave a cry of joy as in the cold gray light I saw Lord John  Roxton kneeling beside me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was he--and yet it was not he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had left him calm in his bearing,  correct in his person, prim in his dress.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now he was pale and  wild-eyed, gasping as he breathed like one who has run far and fast.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His gaunt face was scratched and bloody, his clothes were hanging in  rags, and his hat was gone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I stared in amazement, but he gave me no  chance for questions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was grabbing at our stores all the time he  spoke.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Quick, young fellah.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Quick.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Every moment counts.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Get  the rifles, both of them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have the other two.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, all the  cartridges you can gather.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Fill up your pockets.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, some food.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Half a dozen tins will do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's all right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't wait to talk or  think.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Get a move on, or we are done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Still half-awake, and unable to imagine what it all might mean, I found  myself hurrying madly after him through the wood, a rifle under each  arm and a pile of various stores in my hands.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He dodged in and out  through the thickest of the scrub until he came to a dense clump of  brush-wood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Into this he rushed, regardless of thorns, and threw  himself into the heart of it, pulling me down by his side.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"There.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he panted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I think we are safe here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They'll make for the  camp as sure as fate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It will be their first idea.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But this should  puzzle 'em.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What is it all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked, when I had got my breath.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Where are the  professors.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And who is it that is after us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "The ape-men," he cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"My God, what brutes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Don't raise your  voice, for they have long ears--sharp eyes, too, but no power of scent,  so far as I could judge, so I don't think they can sniff us out.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Where  have you been, young fellah.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You were well out of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    In a few sentences I whispered what I had done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Pretty bad," said he, when he had heard of the dinosaur and the pit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It isn't quite the place for a rest cure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I had no idea  what its possibilities were until those devils got hold of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  man-eatin' Papuans had me once, but they are Chesterfields compared to  this crowd.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "How did it happen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It was in the early mornin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our learned friends were just stirrin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Hadn't even begun to argue yet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly it rained apes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They came  down as thick as apples out of a tree.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They had been assemblin' in the  dark, I suppose, until that great tree over our heads was heavy with  them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I shot one of them through the belly, but before we knew where  we were they had us spread-eagled on our backs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I call them apes, but  they carried sticks and stones in their hands and jabbered talk to each  other, and ended up by tyin' our hands with creepers, so they are ahead  of any beast that I have seen in my wanderin's.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Ape-men--that's what  they are--Missin' Links, and I wish they had stayed missin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They  carried off their wounded comrade--he was bleedin' like a pig--and then  they sat around us, and if ever I saw frozen murder it was in their  faces.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were big fellows, as big as a man and a deal stronger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Curious glassy gray eyes they have, under red tufts, and they just sat  and gloated and gloated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger is no chicken, but even he was  cowed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He managed to struggle to his feet, and yelled out at them to  have done with it and get it over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I think he had gone a bit off his  head at the suddenness of it, for he raged and cursed at them like a  lunatic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If they had been a row of his favorite Pressmen he could not  have slanged them worse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, what did they do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  I was enthralled by the strange story which  my companion was whispering into my ear, while all the time his keen  eyes were shooting in every direction and his hand grasping his cocked  rifle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I thought it was the end of us, but instead of that it started them on  a new line.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They all jabbered and chattered together.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then one of  them stood out beside Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You'll smile, young fellah, but 'pon  my word they might have been kinsmen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I couldn't have believed it if I  hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This old ape-man--he was their  chief--was a sort of red Challenger, with every one of our friend's  beauty points, only just a trifle more so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had the short body, the  big shoulders, the round chest, no neck, a great ruddy frill of a  beard, the tufted eyebrows, the 'What do you want, damn you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>' look  about the eyes, and the whole catalogue.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When the ape-man stood by  Challenger and put his paw on his shoulder, the thing was complete.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee was a bit hysterical, and he laughed till he cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  ape-men laughed too--or at least they put up the devil of a  cacklin'--and they set to work to drag us off through the forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They  wouldn't touch the guns and things--thought them dangerous, I  expect--but they carried away all our loose food.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee and I got  some rough handlin' on the way--there's my skin and my clothes to prove  it--for they took us a bee-line through the brambles, and their own  hides are like leather.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But Challenger was all right.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Four of them  carried him shoulder high, and he went like a Roman emperor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What's  that.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was a strange clicking noise in the distance not unlike castanets.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"There they go.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said my companion, slipping cartridges into the second  double barrelled "Express.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  "Load them all up, young fellah my lad,  for we're not going to be taken alive, and don't you think it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's  the row they make when they are excited.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>they'll have  something to excite them if they put us up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The 'Last Stand of the  Grays' won't be in it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'With their rifles grasped in their stiffened  hands, mid a ring of the dead and dyin',' as some fathead sings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Can  you hear them now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Very far away.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "That little lot will do no good, but I expect their search parties are  all over the wood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, I was telling you my tale of woe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They got  us soon to this town of theirs--about a thousand huts of branches and  leaves in a great grove of trees near the edge of the cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's  three or four miles from here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The filthy beasts fingered me all over,  and I feel as if I should never be clean again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They tied us up--the  fellow who handled me could tie like a bosun--and there we lay with our  toes up, beneath a tree, while a great brute stood guard over us with a  club in his hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When I say 'we' I mean Summerlee and myself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Old  Challenger was up a tree, eatin' pines and havin' the time of his life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm bound to say that he managed to get some fruit to us, and with his  own hands he loosened our bonds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If you'd seen him sitting up in that  tree hob-nobbin' with his twin brother--and singin' in that rollin'  bass of his, 'Ring out, wild bells,' cause music of any kind seemed to  put 'em in a good humor, you'd have smiled; but we weren't in much mood  for laughin', as you can guess.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were inclined, within limits, to  let him do what he liked, but they drew the line pretty sharply at us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a mighty consolation to us all to know that you were runnin'  loose and had the archives in your keepin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, now, young fellah, I'll tell you what will surprise you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You  say you saw signs of men, and fires, traps, and the like.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, we  have seen the natives themselves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Poor devils they were, down-faced  little chaps, and had enough to make them so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It seems that the humans  hold one side of this plateau--over yonder, where you saw the  caves--and the ape-men hold this side, and there is bloody war between  them all the time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's the situation, so far as I could follow it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, yesterday the ape-men got hold of a dozen of the humans and  brought them in as prisoners.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You never heard such a jabberin' and  shriekin' in your life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The men were little red fellows, and had been  bitten and clawed so that they could hardly walk.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The ape-men put two  of them to death there and then--fairly pulled the arm off one of  them--it was perfectly beastly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Plucky little chaps they are, and  hardly gave a squeak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But it turned us absolutely sick.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee  fainted, and even Challenger had as much as he could stand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I think  they have cleared, don't you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    We listened intently, but nothing save the calling of the birds broke  the deep peace of the forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord Roxton went on with his story.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I think you have had the escape of your life, young fellah my lad.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  was catchin' those Indians that put you clean out of their heads, else  they would have been back to the camp for you as sure as fate and  gathered you in.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of course, as you said, they have been watchin' us  from the beginnin' out of that tree, and they knew perfectly well that  we were one short.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>However, they could think only of this new haul; so  it was I, and not a bunch of apes, that dropped in on you in the  morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, we had a horrid business afterwards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My God.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>what a  nightmare the whole thing is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You remember the great bristle of sharp  canes down below where we found the skeleton of the American.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well,  that is just under ape-town, and that's the jumpin'-off place of their  prisoners.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I expect there's heaps of skeletons there, if we looked for  'em.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They have a sort of clear parade-ground on the top, and they make  a proper ceremony about it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One by one the poor devils have to jump,  and the game is to see whether they are merely dashed to pieces or  whether they get skewered on the canes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They took us out to see it,  and the whole tribe lined up on the edge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Four of the Indians jumped,  and the canes went through 'em like knittin' needles through a pat of  butter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No wonder we found that poor Yankee's skeleton with the canes  growin' between his ribs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was horrible--but it was doocedly  interestin' too.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were all fascinated to see them take the dive,  even when we thought it would be our turn next on the spring-board.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, it wasn't.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They kept six of the Indians up for to-day--that's  how I understood it--but I fancy we were to be the star performers in  the show.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger might get off, but Summerlee and I were in the  bill.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their language is more than half signs, and it was not hard to  follow them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So I thought it was time we made a break for it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had  been plottin' it out a bit, and had one or two things clear in my mind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was all on me, for Summerlee was useless and Challenger not much  better.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The only time they got together they got slangin' because they  couldn't agree upon the scientific classification of these red-headed  devils that had got hold of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One said it was the dryopithecus of  Java, the other said it was pithecanthropus.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Madness, I call  it--Loonies, both.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But, as I say, I had thought out one or two points  that were helpful.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One was that these brutes could not run as fast as  a man in the open.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They have short, bandy legs, you see, and heavy  bodies.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even Challenger could give a few yards in a hundred to the  best of them, and you or I would be a perfect Shrubb.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Another point  was that they knew nothin' about guns.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't believe they ever  understood how the fellow I shot came by his hurt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If we could get at  our guns there was no sayin' what we could do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"So I broke away early this mornin', gave my guard a kick in the tummy  that laid him out, and sprinted for the camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There I got you and the  guns, and here we are.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But the professors.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried, in consternation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, we must just go back and fetch 'em.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I couldn't bring 'em with  me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger was up the tree, and Summerlee was not fit for the  effort.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The only chance was to get the guns and try a rescue.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of  course they may scupper them at once in revenge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't think they  would touch Challenger, but I wouldn't answer for Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But they  would have had him in any case.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of that I am certain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So I haven't  made matters any worse by boltin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But we are honor bound to go back  and have them out or see it through with them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So you can make up your  soul, young fellah my lad, for it will be one way or the other before  evenin'.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I have tried to imitate here Lord Roxton's jerky talk, his short,  strong sentences, the half-humorous, half-reckless tone that ran  through it all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But he was a born leader.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As danger thickened his  jaunty manner would increase, his speech become more racy, his cold  eyes glitter into ardent life, and his Don Quixote moustache bristle  with joyous excitement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His love of danger, his intense appreciation  of the drama of an adventure--all the more intense for being held  tightly in--his consistent view that every peril in life is a form of  sport, a fierce game betwixt you and Fate, with Death as a forfeit,  made him a wonderful companion at such hours.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If it were not for our  fears as to the fate of our companions, it would have been a positive  joy to throw myself with such a man into such an affair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were  rising from our brushwood hiding-place when suddenly I felt his grip  upon my arm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"By George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he whispered, "here they come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    From where we lay we could look down a brown aisle, arched with green,  formed by the trunks and branches.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Along this a party of the ape-men  were passing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They went in single file, with bent legs and rounded  backs, their hands occasionally touching the ground, their heads  turning to left and right as they trotted along.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their crouching gait  took away from their height, but I should put them at five feet or so,  with long arms and enormous chests.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Many of them carried sticks, and  at the distance they looked like a line of very hairy and deformed  human beings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment I caught this clear glimpse of them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then  they were lost among the bushes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Not this time," said Lord John, who had caught up his rifle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Our  best chance is to lie quiet until they have given up the search.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then  we shall see whether we can't get back to their town and hit 'em where  it hurts most.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Give 'em an hour and we'll march.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    We filled in the time by opening one of our food tins and making sure  of our breakfast.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord Roxton had had nothing but some fruit since the  morning before and ate like a starving man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, at last, our pockets  bulging with cartridges and a rifle in each hand, we started off upon  our mission of rescue.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Before leaving it we carefully marked our  little hiding-place among the brush-wood and its bearing to Fort  Challenger, that we might find it again if we needed it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We slunk  through the bushes in silence until we came to the very edge of the  cliff, close to the old camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There we halted, and Lord John gave me  some idea of his plans.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"So long as we are among the thick trees these swine are our masters,"  said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"They can see us and we cannot see them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But in the open it  is different.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There we can move faster than they.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So we must stick to  the open all we can.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The edge of the plateau has fewer large trees  than further inland.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So that's our line of advance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Go slowly, keep  your eyes open and your rifle ready.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Above all, never let them get you  prisoner while there is a cartridge left--that's my last word to you,  young fellah.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    When we reached the edge of the cliff I looked over and saw our good  old black Zambo sitting smoking on a rock below us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I would have given  a great deal to have hailed him and told him how we were placed, but it  was too dangerous, lest we should be heard.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The woods seemed to be  full of the ape-men; again and again we heard their curious clicking  chatter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At such times we plunged into the nearest clump of bushes and  lay still until the sound had passed away.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our advance, therefore, was  very slow, and two hours at least must have passed before I saw by Lord  John's cautious movements that we must be close to our destination.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He  motioned to me to lie still, and he crawled forward himself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a  minute he was back again, his face quivering with eagerness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Come quick.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I hope to the Lord we are not too late  already.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I found myself shaking with nervous excitement as I scrambled forward  and lay down beside him, looking out through the bushes at a clearing  which stretched before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a sight which I shall never forget until my dying day--so weird,  so impossible, that I do not know how I am to make you realize it, or  how in a few years I shall bring myself to believe in it if I live to  sit once more on a lounge in the Savage Club and look out on the drab  solidity of the Embankment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I know that it will seem then to be some  wild nightmare, some delirium of fever.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yet I will set it down now,  while it is still fresh in my memory, and one at least, the man who lay  in the damp grasses by my side, will know if I have lied.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A wide, open space lay before us--some hundreds of yards across--all  green turf and low bracken growing to the very edge of the cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Round this clearing there was a semi-circle of trees with curious huts  built of foliage piled one above the other among the branches.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A  rookery, with every nest a little house, would best convey the idea.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The openings of these huts and the branches of the trees were thronged  with a dense mob of ape-people, whom from their size I took to be the  females and infants of the tribe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They formed the background of the  picture, and were all looking out with eager interest at the same scene  which fascinated and bewildered us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the open, and near the edge of the cliff, there had assembled a  crowd of some hundred of these shaggy, red-haired creatures, many of  them of immense size, and all of them horrible to look upon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was  a certain discipline among them, for none of them attempted to break  the line which had been formed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In front there stood a small group of  Indians--little, clean-limbed, red fellows, whose skins glowed like  polished bronze in the strong sunlight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A tall, thin white man was  standing beside them, his head bowed, his arms folded, his whole  attitude expressive of his horror and dejection.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was no  mistaking the angular form of Professor Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In front of and around this dejected group of prisoners were several  ape-men, who watched them closely and made all escape impossible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, right out from all the others and close to the edge of the cliff,  were two figures, so strange, and under other circumstances so  ludicrous, that they absorbed my attention.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The one was our comrade,  Professor Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The remains of his coat still hung in strips  from his shoulders, but his shirt had been all torn out, and his great  beard merged itself in the black tangle which covered his mighty chest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had lost his hat, and his hair, which had grown long in our  wanderings, was flying in wild disorder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A single day seemed to have  changed him from the highest product of modern civilization to the most  desperate savage in South America.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Beside him stood his master, the  king of the ape-men.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In all things he was, as Lord John had said, the  very image of our Professor, save that his coloring was red instead of  black.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The same short, broad figure, the same heavy shoulders, the  same forward hang of the arms, the same bristling beard merging itself  in the hairy chest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Only above the eyebrows, where the sloping  forehead and low, curved skull of the ape-man were in sharp contrast to  the broad brow and magnificent cranium of the European, could one see  any marked difference.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At every other point the king was an absurd  parody of the Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All this, which takes me so long to describe, impressed itself upon me  in a few seconds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then we had very different things to think of, for  an active drama was in progress.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Two of the ape-men had seized one of  the Indians out of the group and dragged him forward to the edge of the  cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The king raised his hand as a signal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They caught the man by  his leg and arm, and swung him three times backwards and forwards with  tremendous violence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, with a frightful heave they shot the poor  wretch over the precipice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With such force did they throw him that he  curved high in the air before beginning to drop.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As he vanished from  sight, the whole assembly, except the guards, rushed forward to the  edge of the precipice, and there was a long pause of absolute silence,  broken by a mad yell of delight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They sprang about, tossing their  long, hairy arms in the air and howling with exultation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then they  fell back from the edge, formed themselves again into line, and waited  for the next victim.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This time it was Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Two of his guards caught him by the wrists  and pulled him brutally to the front.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His thin figure and long limbs  struggled and fluttered like a chicken being dragged from a coop.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger had turned to the king and waved his hands frantically  before him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He was begging, pleading, imploring for his comrade's  life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The ape-man pushed him roughly aside and shook his head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  the last conscious movement he was to make upon earth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John's  rifle cracked, and the king sank down, a tangled red sprawling thing,  upon the ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Shoot into the thick of them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Shoot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>sonny, shoot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried my  companion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There are strange red depths in the soul of the most commonplace man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I am tenderhearted by nature, and have found my eyes moist many a time  over the scream of a wounded hare.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yet the blood lust was on me now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I found myself on my feet emptying one magazine, then the other,  clicking open the breech to re-load, snapping it to again, while  cheering and yelling with pure ferocity and joy of slaughter as I did  so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With our four guns the two of us made a horrible havoc.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Both the  guards who held Summerlee were down, and he was staggering about like a  drunken man in his amazement, unable to realize that he was a free man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The dense mob of ape-men ran about in bewilderment, marveling whence  this storm of death was coming or what it might mean.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They waved,  gesticulated, screamed, and tripped up over those who had fallen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, with a sudden impulse, they all rushed in a howling crowd to the  trees for shelter, leaving the ground behind them spotted with their  stricken comrades.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The prisoners were left for the moment standing  alone in the middle of the clearing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger's quick brain had grasped the situation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He seized the  bewildered Summerlee by the arm, and they both ran towards us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Two of  their guards bounded after them and fell to two bullets from Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We ran forward into the open to meet our friends, and pressed a loaded  rifle into the hands of each.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But Summerlee was at the end of his  strength.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He could hardly totter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Already the ape-men were recovering  from their panic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were coming through the brushwood and  threatening to cut us off.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger and I ran Summerlee along, one  at each of his elbows, while Lord John covered our retreat, firing  again and again as savage heads snarled at us out of the bushes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a  mile or more the chattering brutes were at our very heels.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then the  pursuit slackened, for they learned our power and would no longer face  that unerring rifle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When we had at last reached the camp, we looked  back and found ourselves alone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So it seemed to us; and yet we were mistaken.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had hardly closed the  thornbush door of our zareba, clasped each other's hands, and thrown  ourselves panting upon the ground beside our spring, when we heard a  patter of feet and then a gentle, plaintive crying from outside our  entrance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord Roxton rushed forward, rifle in hand, and threw it  open.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There, prostrate upon their faces, lay the little red figures of  the four surviving Indians, trembling with fear of us and yet imploring  our protection.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With an expressive sweep of his hands one of them  pointed to the woods around them, and indicated that they were full of  danger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, darting forward, he threw his arms round Lord John's  legs, and rested his face upon them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"By George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried our peer, pulling at his moustache in great  perplexity, "I say--what the deuce are we to do with these people.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Get  up, little chappie, and take your face off my boots.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Summerlee was sitting up and stuffing some tobacco into his old briar.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We've got to see them safe," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You've pulled us all out of  the jaws of death.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My word.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>it was a good bit of work.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Admirable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Admirable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Not only we as  individuals, but European science collectively, owe you a deep debt of  gratitude for what you have done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I do not hesitate to say that the  disappearance of Professor Summerlee and myself would have left an  appreciable gap in modern zoological history.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our young friend here  and you have done most excellently well.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He beamed at us with the old paternal smile, but European science would  have been somewhat amazed could they have seen their chosen child, the  hope of the future, with his tangled, unkempt head, his bare chest, and  his tattered clothes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had one of the meat-tins between his knees,  and sat with a large piece of cold Australian mutton between his  fingers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Indian looked up at him, and then, with a little yelp,  cringed to the ground and clung to Lord John's leg.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Don't you be scared, my bonnie boy," said Lord John, patting the  matted head in front of him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"He can't stick your appearance,  Challenger; and, by George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I don't wonder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All right, little chap,  he's only a human, just the same as the rest of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Really, sir.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried the Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, it's lucky for you, Challenger, that you ARE a little out of the  ordinary.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If you hadn't been so like the king----"    "Upon my word, Lord John, you allow yourself great latitude.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, it's a fact.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I beg, sir, that you will change the subject.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Your remarks are  irrelevant and unintelligible.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The question before us is what are we  to do with these Indians.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The obvious thing is to escort them home, if  we knew where their home was.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "There is no difficulty about that," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"They live in the caves  on the other side of the central lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Our young friend here knows where they live.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I gather that it is some  distance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A good twenty miles," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee gave a groan.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I, for one, could never get there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Surely I hear those brutes still  howling upon our track.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    As he spoke, from the dark recesses of the woods we heard far away the  jabbering cry of the ape-men.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Indians once more set up a feeble  wail of fear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We must move, and move quick.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You help Summerlee,  young fellah.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These Indians will carry stores.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now, then, come along  before they can see us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    In less than half-an-hour we had reached our brushwood retreat and  concealed ourselves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All day we heard the excited calling of the  ape-men in the direction of our old camp, but none of them came our  way, and the tired fugitives, red and white, had a long, deep sleep.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  was dozing myself in the evening when someone plucked my sleeve, and I  found Challenger kneeling beside me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You keep a diary of these events, and you expect eventually to publish  it, Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone," said he, with solemnity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I am only here as a Press reporter," I answered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Exactly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You may have heard some rather fatuous remarks of Lord John  Roxton's which seemed to imply that there was some--some  resemblance----"    "Yes, I heard them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I need not say that any publicity given to such an idea--any levity in  your narrative of what occurred--would be exceedingly offensive to me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I will keep well within the truth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Lord John's observations are frequently exceedingly fanciful, and he  is capable of attributing the most absurd reasons to the respect which  is always shown by the most undeveloped races to dignity and character.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You follow my meaning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Entirely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I leave the matter to your discretion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  Then, after a long pause, he  added:  "The king of the ape-men was really a creature of great  distinction--a most remarkably handsome and intelligent personality.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Did it not strike you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A most remarkable creature," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And the Professor, much eased in his mind, settled down to his slumber  once more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER XIV                    "Those Were the Real Conquests"    We had imagined that our pursuers, the ape-men, knew nothing of our  brush-wood hiding-place, but we were soon to find out our mistake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was no sound in the woods--not a leaf moved upon the trees, and  all was peace around us--but we should have been warned by our first  experience how cunningly and how patiently these creatures can watch  and wait until their chance comes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Whatever fate may be mine through  life, I am very sure that I shall never be nearer death than I was that  morning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But I will tell you the thing in its due order.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We all awoke exhausted after the terrific emotions and scanty food of  yesterday.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee was still so weak that it was an effort for him  to stand; but the old man was full of a sort of surly courage which  would never admit defeat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A council was held, and it was agreed that  we should wait quietly for an hour or two where we were, have our  much-needed breakfast, and then make our way across the plateau and  round the central lake to the caves where my observations had shown  that the Indians lived.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We relied upon the fact that we could count  upon the good word of those whom we had rescued to ensure a warm  welcome from their fellows.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, with our mission accomplished and  possessing a fuller knowledge of the secrets of Maple White Land, we  should turn our whole thoughts to the vital problem of our escape and  return.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even Challenger was ready to admit that we should then have  done all for which we had come, and that our first duty from that time  onwards was to carry back to civilization the amazing discoveries we  had made.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were able now to take a more leisurely view of the Indians whom we  had rescued.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were small men, wiry, active, and well-built, with  lank black hair tied up in a bunch behind their heads with a leathern  thong, and leathern also were their loin-clothes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their faces were  hairless, well formed, and good-humored.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The lobes of their ears,  hanging ragged and bloody, showed that they had been pierced for some  ornaments which their captors had torn out.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their speech, though  unintelligible to us, was fluent among themselves, and as they pointed  to each other and uttered the word "Accala" many times over, we  gathered that this was the name of the nation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Occasionally, with  faces which were convulsed with fear and hatred, they shook their  clenched hands at the woods round and cried:  "Doda.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Doda.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" which was  surely their term for their enemies.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What do you make of them, Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" asked Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"One thing is  very clear to me, and that is that the little chap with the front of  his head shaved is a chief among them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was indeed evident that this man stood apart from the others, and  that they never ventured to address him without every sign of deep  respect.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He seemed to be the youngest of them all, and yet, so proud  and high was his spirit that, upon Challenger laying his great hand  upon his head, he started like a spurred horse and, with a quick flash  of his dark eyes, moved further away from the Professor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, placing  his hand upon his breast and holding himself with great dignity, he  uttered the word "Maretas" several times.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Professor, unabashed,  seized the nearest Indian by the shoulder and proceeded to lecture upon  him as if he were a potted specimen in a class-room.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The type of these people," said he in his sonorous fashion, "whether  judged by cranial capacity, facial angle, or any other test, cannot be  regarded as a low one; on the contrary, we must place it as  considerably higher in the scale than many South American tribes which  I can mention.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On no possible supposition can we explain the evolution  of such a race in this place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For that matter, so great a gap  separates these ape-men from the primitive animals which have survived  upon this plateau, that it is inadmissible to think that they could  have developed where we find them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then where the dooce did they drop from.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" asked Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"A question which will, no doubt, be eagerly discussed in every  scientific society in Europe and America," the Professor answered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"My  own reading of the situation for what it is worth--" he inflated his  chest enormously and looked insolently around him at the words--"is  that evolution has advanced under the peculiar conditions of this  country up to the vertebrate stage, the old types surviving and living  on in company with the newer ones.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Thus we find such modern creatures  as the tapir--an animal with quite a respectable length of  pedigree--the great deer, and the ant-eater in the companionship of  reptilian forms of jurassic type.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So much is clear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And now come the  ape-men and the Indian.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What is the scientific mind to think of their  presence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I can only account for it by an invasion from outside.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  is probable that there existed an anthropoid ape in South America, who  in past ages found his way to this place, and that he developed into  the creatures we have seen, some of which"--here he looked hard at  me--"were of an appearance and shape which, if it had been accompanied  by corresponding intelligence, would, I do not hesitate to say, have  reflected credit upon any living race.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to the Indians I cannot  doubt that they are more recent immigrants from below.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Under the  stress of famine or of conquest they have made their way up here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Faced by ferocious creatures which they had never before seen, they  took refuge in the caves which our young friend has described, but they  have no doubt had a bitter fight to hold their own against wild beasts,  and especially against the ape-men who would regard them as intruders,  and wage a merciless war upon them with a cunning which the larger  beasts would lack.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Hence the fact that their numbers appear to be  limited.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, gentlemen, have I read you the riddle aright, or is  there any point which you would query.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Professor Summerlee for once was too depressed to argue, though he  shook his head violently as a token of general disagreement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John  merely scratched his scanty locks with the remark that he couldn't put  up a fight as he wasn't in the same weight or class.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For my own part I  performed my usual role of bringing things down to a strictly prosaic  and practical level by the remark that one of the Indians was missing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"He has gone to fetch some water," said Lord Roxton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We fitted him up  with an empty beef tin and he is off.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "To the old camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No, to the brook.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's among the trees there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It can't be more than  a couple of hundred yards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But the beggar is certainly taking his  time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I'll go and look after him," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I picked up my rifle and  strolled in the direction of the brook, leaving my friends to lay out  the scanty breakfast.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It may seem to you rash that even for so short a  distance I should quit the shelter of our friendly thicket, but you  will remember that we were many miles from Ape-town, that so far as we  knew the creatures had not discovered our retreat, and that in any case  with a rifle in my hands I had no fear of them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had not yet learned  their cunning or their strength.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could hear the murmur of our brook somewhere ahead of me, but there  was a tangle of trees and brushwood between me and it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was making my  way through this at a point which was just out of sight of my  companions, when, under one of the trees, I noticed something red  huddled among the bushes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I approached it, I was shocked to see  that it was the dead body of the missing Indian.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He lay upon his side,  his limbs drawn up, and his head screwed round at a most unnatural  angle, so that he seemed to be looking straight over his own shoulder.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I gave a cry to warn my friends that something was amiss, and running  forwards I stooped over the body.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Surely my guardian angel was very  near me then, for some instinct of fear, or it may have been some faint  rustle of leaves, made me glance upwards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Out of the thick green  foliage which hung low over my head, two long muscular arms covered  with reddish hair were slowly descending.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Another instant and the  great stealthy hands would have been round my throat.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I sprang  backwards, but quick as I was, those hands were quicker still.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Through  my sudden spring they missed a fatal grip, but one of them caught the  back of my neck and the other one my face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I threw my hands up to  protect my throat, and the next moment the huge paw had slid down my  face and closed over them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was lifted lightly from the ground, and I  felt an intolerable pressure forcing my head back and back until the  strain upon the cervical spine was more than I could bear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My senses  swam, but I still tore at the hand and forced it out from my chin.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Looking up I saw a frightful face with cold inexorable light blue eyes  looking down into mine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was something hypnotic in those terrible  eyes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could struggle no longer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As the creature felt me grow limp  in his grasp, two white canines gleamed for a moment at each side of  the vile mouth, and the grip tightened still more upon my chin, forcing  it always upwards and back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A thin, oval-tinted mist formed before my  eyes and little silvery bells tinkled in my ears.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Dully and far off I  heard the crack of a rifle and was feebly aware of the shock as I was  dropped to the earth, where I lay without sense or motion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I awoke to find myself on my back upon the grass in our lair within the  thicket.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Someone had brought the water from the brook, and Lord John  was sprinkling my head with it, while Challenger and Summerlee were  propping me up, with concern in their faces.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment I had a  glimpse of the human spirits behind their scientific masks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  really shock, rather than any injury, which had prostrated me, and in  half-an-hour, in spite of aching head and stiff neck, I was sitting up  and ready for anything.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But you've had the escape of your life, young fellah my lad," said  Lord Roxton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"When I heard your cry and ran forward, and saw your head  twisted half-off and your stohwassers kickin' in the air, I thought we  were one short.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I missed the beast in my flurry, but he dropped you  all right and was off like a streak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I wish I had fifty  men with rifles.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'd clear out the whole infernal gang of them and  leave this country a bit cleaner than we found it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was clear now that the ape-men had in some way marked us down, and  that we were watched on every side.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had not so much to fear from  them during the day, but they would be very likely to rush us by night;  so the sooner we got away from their neighborhood the better.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On three  sides of us was absolute forest, and there we might find ourselves in  an ambush.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But on the fourth side--that which sloped down in the  direction of the lake--there was only low scrub, with scattered trees  and occasional open glades.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was, in fact, the route which I had  myself taken in my solitary journey, and it led us straight for the  Indian caves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This then must for every reason be our road.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One great regret we had, and that was to leave our old camp behind us,  not only for the sake of the stores which remained there, but even more  because we were losing touch with Zambo, our link with the outside  world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>However, we had a fair supply of cartridges and all our guns,  so, for a time at least, we could look after ourselves, and we hoped  soon to have a chance of returning and restoring our communications  with our negro.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had faithfully promised to stay where he was, and  we had not a doubt that he would be as good as his word.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was in the early afternoon that we started upon our journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  young chief walked at our head as our guide, but refused indignantly to  carry any burden.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behind him came the two surviving Indians with our  scanty possessions upon their backs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We four white men walked in the  rear with rifles loaded and ready.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As we started there broke from the  thick silent woods behind us a sudden great ululation of the ape-men,  which may have been a cheer of triumph at our departure or a jeer of  contempt at our flight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Looking back we saw only the dense screen of  trees, but that long-drawn yell told us how many of our enemies lurked  among them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We saw no sign of pursuit, however, and soon we had got  into more open country and beyond their power.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I tramped along, the rearmost of the four, I could not help smiling  at the appearance of my three companions in front.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Was this the  luxurious Lord John Roxton who had sat that evening in the Albany  amidst his Persian rugs and his pictures in the pink radiance of the  tinted lights.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And was this the imposing Professor who had swelled  behind the great desk in his massive study at Enmore Park.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And,  finally, could this be the austere and prim figure which had risen  before the meeting at the Zoological Institute.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No three tramps that  one could have met in a Surrey lane could have looked more hopeless and  bedraggled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had, it is true, been only a week or so upon the top of  the plateau, but all our spare clothing was in our camp below, and the  one week had been a severe one upon us all, though least to me who had  not to endure the handling of the ape-men.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My three friends had all  lost their hats, and had now bound handkerchiefs round their heads,  their clothes hung in ribbons about them, and their unshaven grimy  faces were hardly to be recognized.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Both Summerlee and Challenger were  limping heavily, while I still dragged my feet from weakness after the  shock of the morning, and my neck was as stiff as a board from the  murderous grip that held it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were indeed a sorry crew, and I did  not wonder to see our Indian companions glance back at us occasionally  with horror and amazement on their faces.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the late afternoon we reached the margin of the lake, and as we  emerged from the bush and saw the sheet of water stretching before us  our native friends set up a shrill cry of joy and pointed eagerly in  front of them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was indeed a wonderful sight which lay before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sweeping over the glassy surface was a great flotilla of canoes coming  straight for the shore upon which we stood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were some miles out  when we first saw them, but they shot forward with great swiftness, and  were soon so near that the rowers could distinguish our persons.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Instantly a thunderous shout of delight burst from them, and we saw  them rise from their seats, waving their paddles and spears madly in  the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then bending to their work once more, they flew across the  intervening water, beached their boats upon the sloping sand, and  rushed up to us, prostrating themselves with loud cries of greeting  before the young chief.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally one of them, an elderly man, with a  necklace and bracelet of great lustrous glass beads and the skin of  some beautiful mottled amber-colored animal slung over his shoulders,  ran forward and embraced most tenderly the youth whom we had saved.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He  then looked at us and asked some questions, after which he stepped up  with much dignity and embraced us also each in turn.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, at his  order, the whole tribe lay down upon the ground before us in homage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Personally I felt shy and uncomfortable at this obsequious adoration,  and I read the same feeling in the faces of Roxton and Summerlee, but  Challenger expanded like a flower in the sun.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"They may be undeveloped types," said he, stroking his beard and  looking round at them, "but their deportment in the presence of their  superiors might be a lesson to some of our more advanced Europeans.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Strange how correct are the instincts of the natural man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was clear that the natives had come out upon the war-path, for every  man carried his spear--a long bamboo tipped with bone--his bow and  arrows, and some sort of club or stone battle-axe slung at his side.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their dark, angry glances at the woods from which we had come, and the  frequent repetition of the word "Doda," made it clear enough that this  was a rescue party who had set forth to save or revenge the old chief's  son, for such we gathered that the youth must be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A council was now  held by the whole tribe squatting in a circle, whilst we sat near on a  slab of basalt and watched their proceedings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Two or three warriors  spoke, and finally our young friend made a spirited harangue with such  eloquent features and gestures that we could understand it all as  clearly as if we had known his language.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What is the use of returning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Sooner or later the thing  must be done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Your comrades have been murdered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What if I have  returned safe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These others have been done to death.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There is no  safety for any of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are assembled now and ready.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" Then he pointed  to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"These strange men are our friends.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They are great fighters,  and they hate the ape-men even as we do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They command," here he  pointed up to heaven, "the thunder and the lightning.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When shall we  have such a chance again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let us go forward, and either die now or  live for the future in safety.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How else shall we go back unashamed to  our women.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    The little red warriors hung upon the words of the speaker, and when he  had finished they burst into a roar of applause, waving their rude  weapons in the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The old chief stepped forward to us, and asked us  some questions, pointing at the same time to the woods.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John made  a sign to him that he should wait for an answer and then he turned to  us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, it's up to you to say what you will do," said he; "for my part I  have a score to settle with these monkey-folk, and if it ends by wiping  them off the face of the earth I don't see that the earth need fret  about it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm goin' with our little red pals and I mean to see them  through the scrap.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What do you say, young fellah.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Of course I will come.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And you, Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I will assuredly co-operate.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And you, Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "We seem to be drifting very far from the object of this expedition,  Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I assure you that I little thought when I left my  professional chair in London that it was for the purpose of heading a  raid of savages upon a colony of anthropoid apes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "To such base uses do we come," said Lord John, smiling.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But we are  up against it, so what's the decision.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It seems a most questionable step," said Summerlee, argumentative to  the last, "but if you are all going, I hardly see how I can remain  behind.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Then it is settled," said Lord John, and turning to the chief he  nodded and slapped his rifle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The old fellow clasped our hands, each in turn, while his men cheered  louder than ever.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was too late to advance that night, so the  Indians settled down into a rude bivouac.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On all sides their fires  began to glimmer and smoke.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some of them who had disappeared into the  jungle came back presently driving a young iguanodon before them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Like  the others, it had a daub of asphalt upon its shoulder, and it was only  when we saw one of the natives step forward with the air of an owner  and give his consent to the beast's slaughter that we understood at  last that these great creatures were as much private property as a herd  of cattle, and that these symbols which had so perplexed us were  nothing more than the marks of the owner.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Helpless, torpid, and  vegetarian, with great limbs but a minute brain, they could be rounded  up and driven by a child.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a few minutes the huge beast had been cut  up and slabs of him were hanging over a dozen camp fires, together with  great scaly ganoid fish which had been speared in the lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee had lain down and slept upon the sand, but we others roamed  round the edge of the water, seeking to learn something more of this  strange country.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Twice we found pits of blue clay, such as we had  already seen in the swamp of the pterodactyls.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These were old volcanic  vents, and for some reason excited the greatest interest in Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What attracted Challenger, on the other hand, was a bubbling, gurgling  mud geyser, where some strange gas formed great bursting bubbles upon  the surface.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He thrust a hollow reed into it and cried out with  delight like a schoolboy then he was able, on touching it with a  lighted match, to cause a sharp explosion and a blue flame at the far  end of the tube.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Still more pleased was he when, inverting a leathern  pouch over the end of the reed, and so filling it with the gas, he was  able to send it soaring up into the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"An inflammable gas, and one markedly lighter than the atmosphere.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  should say beyond doubt that it contained a considerable proportion of  free hydrogen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The resources of G.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>E.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>C.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>are not yet exhausted, my  young friend.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I may yet show you how a great mind molds all Nature to  its use.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He swelled with some secret purpose, but would say no more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was nothing which we could see upon the shore which seemed to me  so wonderful as the great sheet of water before us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our numbers and  our noise had frightened all living creatures away, and save for a few  pterodactyls, which soared round high above our heads while they waited  for the carrion, all was still around the camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But it was different  out upon the rose-tinted waters of the central lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It boiled and  heaved with strange life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Great slate-colored backs and high serrated  dorsal fins shot up with a fringe of silver, and then rolled down into  the depths again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The sand-banks far out were spotted with uncouth  crawling forms, huge turtles, strange saurians, and one great flat  creature like a writhing, palpitating mat of black greasy leather,  which flopped its way slowly to the lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here and there high serpent  heads projected out of the water, cutting swiftly through it with a  little collar of foam in front, and a long swirling wake behind, rising  and falling in graceful, swan-like undulations as they went.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  not until one of these creatures wriggled on to a sand-bank within a  few hundred yards of us, and exposed a barrel-shaped body and huge  flippers behind the long serpent neck, that Challenger, and Summerlee,  who had joined us, broke out into their duet of wonder and admiration.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Plesiosaurus.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A fresh-water plesiosaurus.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"That I  should have lived to see such a sight.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are blessed, my dear  Challenger, above all zoologists since the world began.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was not until the night had fallen, and the fires of our savage  allies glowed red in the shadows, that our two men of science could be  dragged away from the fascinations of that primeval lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even in the  darkness as we lay upon the strand, we heard from time to time the  snort and plunge of the huge creatures who lived therein.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At earliest dawn our camp was astir and an hour later we had started  upon our memorable expedition.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Often in my dreams have I thought that  I might live to be a war correspondent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In what wildest one could I  have conceived the nature of the campaign which it should be my lot to  report.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here then is my first despatch from a field of battle:    Our numbers had been reinforced during the night by a fresh batch of  natives from the caves, and we may have been four or five hundred  strong when we made our advance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A fringe of scouts was thrown out in  front, and behind them the whole force in a solid column made their way  up the long slope of the bush country until we were near the edge of  the forest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here they spread out into a long straggling line of  spearmen and bowmen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Roxton and Summerlee took their position upon the  right flank, while Challenger and I were on the left.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a host of  the stone age that we were accompanying to battle--we with the last  word of the gunsmith's art from St.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>James' Street and the Strand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had not long to wait for our enemy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A wild shrill clamor rose from  the edge of the wood and suddenly a body of ape-men rushed out with  clubs and stones, and made for the center of the Indian line.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a  valiant move but a foolish one, for the great bandy-legged creatures  were slow of foot, while their opponents were as active as cats.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  was horrible to see the fierce brutes with foaming mouths and glaring  eyes, rushing and grasping, but forever missing their elusive enemies,  while arrow after arrow buried itself in their hides.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One great fellow  ran past me roaring with pain, with a dozen darts sticking from his  chest and ribs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In mercy I put a bullet through his skull, and he fell  sprawling among the aloes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But this was the only shot fired, for the  attack had been on the center of the line, and the Indians there had  needed no help of ours in repulsing it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of all the ape-men who had  rushed out into the open, I do not think that one got back to cover.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But the matter was more deadly when we came among the trees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For an  hour or more after we entered the wood, there was a desperate struggle  in which for a time we hardly held our own.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Springing out from among  the scrub the ape-men with huge clubs broke in upon the Indians and  often felled three or four of them before they could be speared.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their  frightful blows shattered everything upon which they fell.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One of them  knocked Summerlee's rifle to matchwood and the next would have crushed  his skull had an Indian not stabbed the beast to the heart.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Other  ape-men in the trees above us hurled down stones and logs of wood,  occasionally dropping bodily on to our ranks and fighting furiously  until they were felled.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once our allies broke under the pressure, and  had it not been for the execution done by our rifles they would  certainly have taken to their heels.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But they were gallantly rallied  by their old chief and came on with such a rush that the ape-men began  in turn to give way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Summerlee was weaponless, but I was emptying my  magazine as quick as I could fire, and on the further flank we heard  the continuous cracking of our companion's rifles.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then in a moment came the panic and the collapse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Screaming and  howling, the great creatures rushed away in all directions through the  brushwood, while our allies yelled in their savage delight, following  swiftly after their flying enemies.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All the feuds of countless  generations, all the hatreds and cruelties of their narrow history, all  the memories of ill-usage and persecution were to be purged that day.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At last man was to be supreme and the man-beast to find forever his  allotted place.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Fly as they would the fugitives were too slow to  escape from the active savages, and from every side in the tangled  woods we heard the exultant yells, the twanging of bows, and the crash  and thud as ape-men were brought down from their hiding-places in the  trees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was following the others, when I found that Lord John and Challenger  had come across to join us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It's over," said Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I think we can leave the tidying up to  them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps the less we see of it the better we shall sleep.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Challenger's eyes were shining with the lust of slaughter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We have been privileged," he cried, strutting about like a gamecock,  "to be present at one of the typical decisive battles of history--the  battles which have determined the fate of the world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What, my friends,  is the conquest of one nation by another.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is meaningless.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Each  produces the same result.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But those fierce fights, when in the dawn of  the ages the cave-dwellers held their own against the tiger folk, or  the elephants first found that they had a master, those were the real  conquests--the victories that count.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By this strange turn of fate we  have seen and helped to decide even such a contest.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now upon this  plateau the future must ever be for man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It needed a robust faith in the end to justify such tragic means.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As  we advanced together through the woods we found the ape-men lying  thick, transfixed with spears or arrows.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Here and there a little group  of shattered Indians marked where one of the anthropoids had turned to  bay, and sold his life dearly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Always in front of us we heard the  yelling and roaring which showed the direction of the pursuit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  ape-men had been driven back to their city, they had made a last stand  there, once again they had been broken, and now we were in time to see  the final fearful scene of all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some eighty or a hundred males, the  last survivors, had been driven across that same little clearing which  led to the edge of the cliff, the scene of our own exploit two days  before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As we arrived the Indians, a semicircle of spearmen, had  closed in on them, and in a minute it was over, Thirty or forty died  where they stood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The others, screaming and clawing, were thrust over  the precipice, and went hurtling down, as their prisoners had of old,  on to the sharp bamboos six hundred feet below.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was as Challenger  had said, and the reign of man was assured forever in Maple White Land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The males were exterminated, Ape Town was destroyed, the females and  young were driven away to live in bondage, and the long rivalry of  untold centuries had reached its bloody end.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For us the victory brought much advantage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once again we were able to  visit our camp and get at our stores.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Once more also we were able to  communicate with Zambo, who had been terrified by the spectacle from  afar of an avalanche of apes falling from the edge of the cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Come away, Massas, come away.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried, his eyes starting from his  head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The debbil get you sure if you stay up there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is the voice of sanity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said Summerlee with conviction.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We have  had adventures enough and they are neither suitable to our character or  our position.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I hold you to your word, Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From now  onwards  you devote your energies to getting us out of this horrible country and  back once more to civilization.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"                                      CHAPTER XV                    "Our Eyes have seen Great Wonders"    I write this from day to day, but I trust that before I come to the end  of it, I may be able to say that the light shines, at last, through our  clouds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are held here with no clear means of making our escape, and  bitterly we chafe against it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yet, I can well imagine that the day may  come when we may be glad that we were kept, against our will, to see  something more of the wonders of this singular place, and of the  creatures who inhabit it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The victory of the Indians and the annihilation of the ape-men, marked  the turning point of our fortunes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From then onwards, we were in truth  masters of the plateau, for the natives looked upon us with a mixture  of fear and gratitude, since by our strange powers we had aided them to  destroy their hereditary foe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For their own sakes they would, perhaps,  be glad to see the departure of such formidable and incalculable  people, but they have not themselves suggested any way by which we may  reach the plains below.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There had been, so far as we could follow  their signs, a tunnel by which the place could be approached, the lower  exit of which we had seen from below.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By this, no doubt, both ape-men  and Indians had at different epochs reached the top, and Maple White  with his companion had taken the same way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Only the year before,  however, there had been a terrific earthquake, and the upper end of the  tunnel had fallen in and completely disappeared.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The Indians now could  only shake their heads and shrug their shoulders when we expressed by  signs our desire to descend.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It may be that they cannot, but it may  also be that they will not, help us to get away.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At the end of the victorious campaign the surviving ape-folk were  driven across the plateau (their wailings were horrible) and  established in the neighborhood of the Indian caves, where they would,  from now onwards, be a servile race under the eyes of their masters.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a rude, raw, primeval version of the Jews in Babylon or the  Israelites in Egypt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At night we could hear from amid the trees the  long-drawn cry, as some primitive Ezekiel mourned for fallen greatness  and recalled the departed glories of Ape Town.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Hewers of wood and  drawers of water, such were they from now onwards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had returned across the plateau with our allies two days after the  battle, and made our camp at the foot of their cliffs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They would have  had us share their caves with them, but Lord John would by no means  consent to it considering that to do so would put us in their power if  they were treacherously disposed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We kept our independence, therefore,  and had our weapons ready for any emergency, while preserving the most  friendly relations.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We also continually visited their caves, which  were most remarkable places, though whether made by man or by Nature we  have never been able to determine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were all on the one stratum,  hollowed out of some soft rock which lay between the volcanic basalt  forming the ruddy cliffs above them, and the hard granite which formed  their base.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The openings were about eighty feet above the ground, and were led up  to by long stone stairs, so narrow and steep that no large animal could  mount them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Inside they were warm and dry, running in straight  passages of varying length into the side of the hill, with smooth gray  walls decorated with many excellent pictures done with charred sticks  and representing the various animals of the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If every living  thing were swept from the country the future explorer would find upon  the walls of these caves ample evidence of the strange fauna--the  dinosaurs, iguanodons, and fish lizards--which had lived so recently  upon earth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Since we had learned that the huge iguanodons were kept as tame herds  by their owners, and were simply walking meat-stores, we had conceived  that man, even with his primitive weapons, had established his  ascendancy upon the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We were soon to discover that it was not  so, and that he was still there upon tolerance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was on the third day after our forming our camp near the Indian  caves that the tragedy occurred.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger and Summerlee had gone off  together that day to the lake where some of the natives, under their  direction, were engaged in harpooning specimens of the great lizards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John and I had remained in our camp, while a number of the Indians  were scattered about upon the grassy slope in front of the caves  engaged in different ways.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly there was a shrill cry of alarm,  with the word "Stoa" resounding from a hundred tongues.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From every  side men, women, and children were rushing wildly for shelter, swarming  up the staircases and into the caves in a mad stampede.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Looking up, we could see them waving their arms from the rocks above  and beckoning to us to join them in their refuge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had both seized  our magazine rifles and ran out to see what the danger could be.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly from the near belt of trees there broke forth a group of  twelve or fifteen Indians, running for their lives, and at their very  heels two of those frightful monsters which had disturbed our camp and  pursued me upon my solitary journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In shape they were like horrible  toads, and moved in a succession of springs, but in size they were of  an incredible bulk, larger than the largest elephant.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had never  before seen them save at night,  and indeed they are nocturnal animals  save when disturbed in their lairs, as these had been.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We now stood  amazed at the sight, for their blotched and warty skins were of a  curious fish-like iridescence, and the sunlight struck them with an  ever-varying rainbow bloom as they moved.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had little time to watch them, however, for in an instant they had  overtaken the fugitives and were making a dire slaughter among them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their method was to fall forward with their full weight upon each in  turn, leaving him crushed and mangled, to bound on after the others.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The wretched Indians screamed with terror, but were helpless, run as  they would, before the relentless purpose and horrible activity of  these monstrous creatures.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One after another they went down, and there  were not half-a-dozen surviving by the time my companion and I could  come to their help.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But our aid was of little avail and only involved  us in the same peril.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At the range of a couple of hundred yards we  emptied our magazines, firing bullet after bullet into the beasts, but  with no more effect than if we were pelting them with pellets of paper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Their slow reptilian natures cared nothing for wounds, and the springs  of their lives, with no special brain center but scattered throughout  their spinal cords, could not be tapped by any modern weapons.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  most that we could do was to check their progress by distracting their  attention with the flash and roar of our guns, and so to give both the  natives and ourselves time to reach the steps which led to safety.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But  where the conical explosive bullets of the twentieth century were of no  avail, the poisoned arrows of the natives, dipped in the juice of  strophanthus and steeped afterwards in decayed carrion, could succeed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such arrows were of little avail to the hunter who attacked the beast,  because their action in that torpid circulation was slow, and before  its powers failed it could certainly overtake and slay its assailant.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But now, as the two monsters hounded us to the very foot of the stairs,  a drift of darts came whistling from every chink in the cliff above  them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a minute they were feathered with them, and yet with no sign  of pain they clawed and slobbered with impotent rage at the steps which  would lead them to their victims, mounting clumsily up for a few yards  and then sliding down again to the ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But at last the poison  worked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One of them gave a deep rumbling groan and dropped his huge  squat head on to the earth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The other bounded round in an eccentric  circle with shrill, wailing cries, and then lying down writhed in agony  for some minutes before it also stiffened and lay still.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With yells of  triumph the Indians came flocking down from their caves and danced a  frenzied dance of victory round the dead bodies, in mad joy that two  more of the most dangerous of all their enemies had been slain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That  night they cut up and removed the bodies, not to eat--for the poison  was still active--but lest they should breed a pestilence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The great  reptilian hearts, however, each as large as a cushion, still lay there,  beating slowly and steadily, with a gentle rise and fall, in horrible  independent life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was only upon the third day that the ganglia ran  down and the dreadful things were still.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some day, when I have a better desk than a meat-tin and more helpful  tools than a worn stub of pencil and a last, tattered note-book, I will  write some fuller account of the Accala Indians--of our life amongst  them, and of the glimpses which we had of the strange conditions of  wondrous Maple White Land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Memory, at least, will never fail me, for  so long as the breath of life is in me, every hour and every action of  that period will stand out as hard and clear as do the first strange  happenings of our childhood.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No new impressions could efface those  which are so deeply cut.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When the time comes I will describe that  wondrous moonlit night upon the great lake when a young  ichthyosaurus--a strange creature, half seal, half fish, to look at,  with bone-covered eyes on each side of his snout, and a third eye fixed  upon the top of his head--was entangled in an Indian net, and nearly  upset our canoe before we towed it ashore; the same night that a green  water-snake shot out from the rushes and carried off in its coils the  steersman of Challenger's canoe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I will tell, too, of the great  nocturnal white thing--to this day we do not know whether it was beast  or reptile--which lived in a vile swamp to the east of the lake, and  flitted about with a faint phosphorescent glimmer in the darkness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  Indians were so terrified at it that they would not go near the place,  and, though we twice made expeditions and saw it each time, we could  not make our way through the deep marsh in which it lived.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I can only  say that it seemed to be larger than a cow and had the strangest musky  odor.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I will tell also of the huge bird which chased Challenger to the  shelter of the rocks one day--a great running bird, far taller than an  ostrich, with a vulture-like neck and cruel head which made it a  walking death.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As Challenger climbed to safety one dart of that savage  curving beak shore off the heel of his boot as if it had been cut with  a chisel.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This time at least modern weapons prevailed and the great  creature, twelve feet from head to foot--phororachus its name,  according to our panting but exultant Professor--went down before Lord  Roxton's rifle in a flurry of waving feathers and kicking limbs, with  two remorseless yellow eyes glaring up from the midst of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>May I  live to see that flattened vicious skull in its own niche amid the  trophies of the Albany.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally, I will assuredly give some account of  the toxodon, the giant ten-foot guinea pig, with projecting chisel  teeth, which we killed as it drank in the gray of the morning by the  side of the lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All this I shall some day write at fuller length, and amidst these more  stirring days I would tenderly sketch in these lovely summer evenings,  when with the deep blue sky above us we lay in good comradeship among  the long grasses by the wood and marveled at the strange fowl that  swept over us and the quaint new creatures which crept from their  burrows to watch us, while above us the boughs of the bushes were heavy  with luscious fruit, and below us strange and lovely flowers peeped at  us from among the herbage; or those long moonlit nights when we lay out  upon the shimmering surface of the great lake and watched with wonder  and awe the huge circles rippling out from the sudden splash of some  fantastic monster; or the greenish gleam, far down in the deep water,  of some strange creature upon the confines of darkness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These are the  scenes which my mind and my pen will dwell upon in every detail at some  future day.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But, you will ask, why these experiences and why this delay, when you  and your comrades should have been occupied day and night in the  devising of some means by which you could return to the outer world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My answer is, that there was not one of us who was not working for this  end, but that our work had been in vain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One fact we had very speedily  discovered:  The Indians would do nothing to help us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In every other  way they were our friends--one might almost say our devoted slaves--but  when it was suggested that they should help us to make and carry a  plank which would bridge the chasm, or when we wished to get from them  thongs of leather or liana to weave ropes which might help us, we were  met by a good-humored, but an invincible, refusal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They would smile,  twinkle their eyes, shake their heads, and there was the end of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even the old chief met us with the same obstinate denial, and it was  only Maretas, the youngster whom we had saved, who looked wistfully at  us and told us by his gestures that he was grieved for our thwarted  wishes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Ever since their crowning triumph with the ape-men they looked  upon us as supermen, who bore victory in the tubes of strange weapons,  and they believed that so long as we remained with them good fortune  would be theirs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A little red-skinned wife and a cave of our own were  freely offered to each of us if we would but forget our own people and  dwell forever upon the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So far all had been kindly, however  far apart our desires might be; but we felt well assured that our  actual plans of a descent must be kept secret, for we had reason to  fear that at the last they might try to hold us by force.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In spite of the danger from dinosaurs (which is not great save at  night, for, as I may have said before, they are mostly nocturnal in  their habits) I have twice in the last three weeks been over to our old  camp in order to see our negro who still kept watch and ward below the  cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>My eyes strained eagerly across the great plain in the hope of  seeing afar off the help for which we had prayed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But the long  cactus-strewn levels still stretched away, empty and bare, to the  distant line of the cane-brake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"They will soon come now, Massa Malone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Before another week pass  Indian come back and bring rope and fetch you down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  Such was the  cheery cry of our excellent Zambo.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had one strange experience as I came from this second visit which had  involved my being away for a night from my companions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was returning  along the well-remembered route, and had reached a spot within a mile  or so of the marsh of the pterodactyls, when I saw an extraordinary  object approaching me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a man who walked inside a framework made  of bent canes so that he was enclosed on all sides in a bell-shaped  cage.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I drew nearer I was more amazed still to see that it was Lord  John Roxton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When he saw me he slipped from under his curious  protection and came towards me laughing, and yet, as I thought, with  some confusion in his manner.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, young fellah," said he, "who would have thought of meetin' you  up here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "What in the world are you doing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Visitin' my friends, the pterodactyls," said  he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"But why.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Interestin' beasts, don't you think.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But unsociable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Nasty rude ways  with strangers, as you may remember.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So I rigged this framework which  keeps them from bein' too pressin' in their attentions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "But what do you want in the swamp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He looked at me with a very questioning eye, and I read hesitation in  his face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Don't you think other people besides Professors can want to know  things.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he said at last.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I'm studyin' the pretty dears.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's  enough for you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No offense," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His good-humor returned and he laughed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No offense, young fellah.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm goin' to get a young devil chick for  Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That's one of my jobs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No, I don't want your company.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I'm safe in this cage, and you are not.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So long, and I'll be back in  camp by night-fall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He turned away and I left him wandering on through the wood with his  extraordinary cage around him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If Lord John's behavior at this time was strange, that of Challenger  was more so.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I may say that he seemed to possess an extraordinary  fascination for the Indian women, and that he always carried a large  spreading palm branch with which he beat them off as if they were  flies, when their attentions became too pressing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>To see him walking  like a comic opera Sultan, with this badge of authority in his hand,  his black beard bristling in front of him, his toes pointing at each  step, and a train of wide-eyed Indian girls behind him, clad in their  slender drapery of bark cloth, is one of the most grotesque of all the  pictures which I will carry back with me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to Summerlee, he was  absorbed in the insect and bird life of the plateau, and spent his  whole time (save that considerable portion which was devoted to abusing  Challenger for not getting us out of our difficulties) in cleaning and  mounting his specimens.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger had been in the habit of walking off by himself every  morning and returning from time to time with looks of portentous  solemnity, as one who bears the full weight of a great enterprise upon  his shoulders.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One day, palm branch in hand, and his crowd of adoring  devotees behind him, he led us down to his hidden work-shop and took us  into the secret of his plans.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The place was a small clearing in the center of a palm grove.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In this  was one of those boiling mud geysers which I have already described.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Around its edge were scattered a number of leathern thongs cut from  iguanodon hide, and a large collapsed membrane which proved to be the  dried and scraped stomach of one of the great fish lizards from the  lake.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This huge sack had been sewn up at one end and only a small  orifice left at the other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Into this opening several bamboo canes had  been inserted and the other ends of these canes were in contact with  conical clay funnels which collected the gas bubbling up through the  mud of the geyser.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Soon the flaccid organ began to slowly expand and  show such a tendency to upward movements that Challenger fastened the  cords which held it to the trunks of the surrounding trees.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In half an  hour a good-sized gas-bag had been formed, and the jerking and  straining upon the thongs showed that it was capable of considerable  lift.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Challenger, like a glad father in the presence of his  first-born, stood smiling and stroking his beard, in silent,  self-satisfied content as he gazed at the creation of his brain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  was Summerlee who first broke the silence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You don't mean us to go up in that thing, Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said he, in an  acid voice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I mean, my dear Summerlee, to give you such a demonstration of its  powers that after seeing it you will, I am sure, have no hesitation in  trusting yourself to it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "You can put it right out of your head now, at once," said Summerlee  with decision, "nothing on earth would induce me to commit such a  folly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John, I trust that you will not countenance such madness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Dooced ingenious, I call it," said our peer.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I'd like to see how it  works.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "So you shall," said Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"For some days I have exerted my  whole brain force upon the problem of how we shall descend from these  cliffs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We have satisfied ourselves that we cannot climb down and that  there is no tunnel.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are also unable to construct any kind of bridge  which may take us back to the pinnacle from which we came.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How then  shall I find a means to convey us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some little time ago I had remarked  to our young friend here that free hydrogen was evolved from the  geyser.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The idea of a balloon naturally followed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was, I will  admit, somewhat baffled by the difficulty of discovering an envelope to  contain the gas, but the contemplation of the immense entrails of these  reptiles supplied me with a solution to the problem.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Behold the  result.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He put one hand in the front of his ragged jacket and pointed proudly  with the other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>By this time the gas-bag had swollen to a goodly rotundity and was  jerking strongly upon its lashings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Midsummer madness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" snorted Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John was delighted with the whole idea.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Clever old dear, ain't  he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he whispered to me, and then louder to Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What about a  car.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "The car will be my next care.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have already planned how it is to be  made and attached.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Meanwhile I will simply show you how capable my  apparatus is of supporting the weight of each of us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "All of us, surely.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No, it is part of my plan that each in turn shall descend as in a  parachute, and the balloon be drawn back by means which I shall have no  difficulty in perfecting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If it will support the weight of one and let  him gently down, it will have done all that is required of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I will  now show you its capacity in that direction.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He brought out a lump of basalt of a considerable size, constructed in  the middle so that a cord could be easily attached to it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This cord  was the one which we had brought with us on to the plateau after we had  used it for climbing the pinnacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was over a hundred feet long,  and though it was thin it was very strong.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had prepared a sort of  collar of leather with many straps depending from it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This collar was  placed over the dome of the balloon, and the hanging thongs were  gathered together below, so that the pressure of any weight would be  diffused over a considerable surface.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then the lump of basalt was  fastened to the thongs, and the rope was allowed to hang from the end  of it, being passed three times round the Professor's arm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I will now," said Challenger, with a smile of pleased anticipation,  "demonstrate the carrying power of my balloon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" As he said so he cut  with a knife the various lashings that held it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Never was our expedition in more imminent danger of complete  annihilation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The inflated membrane shot up with frightful velocity  into the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In an instant Challenger was pulled off his feet and  dragged after it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I had just time to throw my arms round his ascending  waist when I was myself whipped up into the air.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Lord John had me with  a rat-trap grip round the legs, but I felt that he also was coming off  the ground.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment I had a vision of four adventurers floating  like a string of sausages over the land that they had explored.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But,  happily, there were limits to the strain which the rope would stand,  though none apparently to the lifting powers of this infernal machine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a sharp crack, and we were in a heap upon the ground with  coils of rope all over us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When we were able to stagger to our feet we  saw far off in the deep blue sky one dark spot where the lump of basalt  was speeding upon its way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Splendid.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried the undaunted Challenger, rubbing his injured arm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"A most thorough and satisfactory demonstration.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I could not have  anticipated such a success.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Within a week, gentlemen, I promise that a  second balloon will be prepared, and that you can count upon taking in  safety and comfort the first stage of our homeward journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" So far I  have written each of the foregoing events as it occurred.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now I am  rounding off my narrative from the old camp, where Zambo has waited so  long, with all our difficulties and dangers left like a dream behind us  upon the summit of those vast ruddy crags which tower above our heads.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We have descended in safety, though in a most unexpected fashion, and  all is well with us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In six weeks or two months we shall be in London,  and it is possible that this letter may not reach you much earlier than  we do ourselves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Already our hearts yearn and our spirits fly towards  the great mother city which holds so much that is dear to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was on the very evening of our perilous adventure with Challenger's  home-made balloon that the change came in our fortunes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have said  that the one person from whom we had had some sign of sympathy in our  attempts to get away was the young chief whom we had rescued.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He alone  had no desire to hold us against our will in a strange land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He had  told us as much by his expressive language of signs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That evening,  after dusk, he came down to our little camp, handed me (for some reason  he had always shown his attentions to me, perhaps because I was the one  who was nearest his age) a small roll of the bark of a tree, and then  pointing solemnly up at the row of caves above him, he had put his  finger to his lips as a sign of secrecy and had stolen back again to  his people.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I took the slip of bark to the firelight and we examined it together.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was about a foot square, and on the inner side there was a singular  arrangement of lines, which I here reproduce:      They were neatly done in charcoal upon the white surface, and looked to  me at first sight like some sort of rough musical score.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Whatever it is, I can swear that it is of importance to us," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I could read that on his face as he gave it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Unless we have come upon a primitive practical joker," Summerlee  suggested, "which I should think would be one of the most elementary  developments of man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is clearly some sort of script," said Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Looks like a guinea puzzle competition," remarked Lord John, craning  his neck to have a look at it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then suddenly he stretched out his hand  and seized the puzzle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"By George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he cried, "I believe I've got it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The boy guessed right  the very first time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>See here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How many marks are on that paper.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Eighteen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, if you come to think of it there are eighteen cave  openings on the hill-side above us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "He pointed up to the caves when he gave it to me," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, that settles it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This is a chart of the caves.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Eighteen  of them all in a row, some short, some deep, some branching, same as we  saw them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It's a map, and here's a cross on it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What's the cross for.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is placed to mark one that is much deeper than the others.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "One that goes through," I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I believe our young friend has read the riddle," said Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"If  the cave does not go through I do not understand why this person, who  has every reason to mean us well, should have drawn our attention to  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But if it does go through and comes out at the corresponding point  on the other side, we should not have more than a hundred feet to  descend.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "A hundred feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" grumbled Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, our rope is still more than a hundred feet long," I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Surely we could get down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "How about the Indians in the cave.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" Summerlee objected.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"There are no Indians in any of the caves above our heads," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"They are all used as barns and store-houses.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Why should we not go up  now at once and spy out the land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    There is a dry bituminous wood upon the plateau--a species of  araucaria, according to our botanist--which is always used by the  Indians for torches.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Each of us picked up a faggot of this, and we  made our way up weed-covered steps to the particular cave which was  marked in the drawing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was, as I had said, empty, save for a great  number of enormous bats, which flapped round our heads as we advanced  into it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As we had no desire to draw the attention of the Indians to  our proceedings, we stumbled along in the dark until we had gone round  several curves and penetrated a considerable distance into the cavern.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, at last, we lit our torches.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a beautiful dry tunnel with  smooth gray walls covered with native symbols, a curved roof which  arched over our heads, and white glistening sand beneath our feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We  hurried eagerly along it until, with a deep groan of bitter  disappointment, we were brought to a halt.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A sheer wall of rock had  appeared before us, with no chink through which a mouse could have  slipped.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was no escape for us there.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We stood with bitter hearts staring at this unexpected obstacle.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  was not the result of any convulsion, as in the case of the ascending  tunnel.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The end wall was exactly like the side ones.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was, and had  always been, a cul-de-sac.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Never mind, my friends," said the indomitable Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You have  still my firm promise of a balloon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Summerlee groaned.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Can we be in the wrong cave.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I suggested.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"No use, young fellah," said Lord John, with his finger on the chart.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Seventeen from the right and second from the left.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This is the cave  sure enough.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I looked at the mark to which his finger pointed, and I gave a sudden  cry of joy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I believe I have it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Follow me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Follow me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I hurried back along the way we had come, my torch in my hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Here,"  said I, pointing to some matches upon the ground, "is where we lit up.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Exactly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Well, it is marked as a forked cave, and in the darkness we passed the  fork before the torches were lit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On the right side as we go out we  should find the longer arm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was as I had said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had not gone thirty yards before a great  black opening loomed in the wall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We turned into it to find that we  were in a much larger passage than before.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Along it we hurried in  breathless impatience for many hundreds of yards.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Then, suddenly, in  the black darkness of the arch in front of us we saw a gleam of dark  red light.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We stared in amazement.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A sheet of steady flame seemed to  cross the passage and to bar our way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We hastened towards it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No  sound, no heat, no movement came from it, but still the great luminous  curtain glowed before us, silvering all the cave and turning the sand  to powdered jewels, until as we drew closer it discovered a circular  edge.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"The moon, by George.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" cried Lord John.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We are through, boys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are  through.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    It was indeed the full moon which shone straight down the aperture  which opened upon the cliffs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was a small rift, not larger than a  window, but it was enough for all our purposes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As we craned our necks  through it we could see that the descent was not a very difficult one,  and that the level ground was no very great way below us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was no  wonder that from below we had not observed the place, as the cliffs  curved overhead and an ascent at the spot would have seemed so  impossible as to discourage close inspection.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We satisfied ourselves  that with the help of our rope we could find our way down, and then  returned, rejoicing, to our camp to make our preparations for the next  evening.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What we did we had to do quickly and secretly, since even at this last  hour the Indians might hold us back.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our stores we would leave behind  us, save only our guns and cartridges.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But Challenger had some  unwieldy stuff which he ardently desired to take with him, and one  particular package, of which I may not speak, which gave us more labor  than any.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Slowly the day passed, but when the darkness fell we were  ready for our departure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>With much labor we got our things up the  steps, and then, looking back, took one last long survey of that  strange land, soon I fear to be vulgarized, the prey of hunter and  prospector, but to each of us a dreamland of glamour and romance, a  land where we had dared much, suffered much, and learned much--OUR  land, as we shall ever fondly call it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Along upon our left the  neighboring caves each threw out its ruddy cheery firelight into the  gloom.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From the slope below us rose the voices of the Indians as they  laughed and sang.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Beyond was the long sweep of the woods, and in the  center, shimmering vaguely through the gloom, was the great lake, the  mother of strange monsters.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even as we looked a high whickering cry,  the call of some weird animal, rang clear out of the darkness.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  the very voice of Maple White Land bidding us good-bye.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We turned and  plunged into the cave which led to home.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Two hours later, we, our packages, and all we owned, were at the foot  of the cliff.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Save for Challenger's luggage we had never a difficulty.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Leaving it all where we descended, we started at once for Zambo's camp.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In the early morning we approached it, but only to find, to our  amazement, not one fire but a dozen upon the plain.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The rescue party  had arrived.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There were twenty Indians from the river, with stakes,  ropes, and all that could be useful for bridging the chasm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At least  we shall have no difficulty now in carrying our packages, when  to-morrow we begin to make our way back to the Amazon.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And so, in humble and thankful mood, I close this account.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Our eyes  have seen great wonders and our souls are chastened by what we have  endured.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Each is in his own way a better and deeper man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It may be  that when we reach Para we shall stop to refit.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If we do, this letter  will be a mail ahead.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If not, it will reach London on the very day  that I do.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In either case, my dear Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>McArdle, I hope very soon to  shake you by the hand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>CHAPTER XVI                      "A Procession.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A Procession.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    I should wish to place upon record here our gratitude to all our  friends upon the Amazon for the very great kindness and hospitality  which was shown to us upon our return journey.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Very particularly would  I thank Senhor Penalosa and other officials of the Brazilian Government  for the special arrangements by which we were helped upon our way, and  Senhor Pereira of Para, to whose forethought we owe the complete outfit  for a decent appearance in the civilized world which we found ready for  us at that town.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It seemed a poor return for all the courtesy which we  encountered that we should deceive our hosts and benefactors, but under  the circumstances we had really no alternative, and I hereby tell them  that they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to  follow upon our traces.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even the names have been altered in our  accounts, and I am very sure that no one, from the most careful study  of them, could come within a thousand miles of our unknown land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The excitement which had been caused through those parts of South  America which we had to traverse was imagined by us to be purely local,  and I can assure our friends in England that we had no notion of the  uproar which the mere rumor of our experiences had caused through  Europe.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was not until the Ivernia was within five hundred miles of  Southampton that the wireless messages from paper after paper and  agency after agency, offering huge prices for a short return message as  to our actual results, showed us how strained was the attention not  only of the scientific world but of the general public.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was agreed  among us, however, that no definite statement should be given to the  Press until we had met the members of the Zoological Institute, since  as delegates it was our clear duty to give our first report to the body  from which we had received our commission of investigation.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Thus,  although we found Southampton full of Pressmen, we absolutely refused  to give any information, which had the natural effect of focussing  public attention upon the meeting which was advertised for the evening  of November 7th.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For this gathering, the Zoological Hall which had  been the scene of the inception of our task was found to be far too  small, and it was only in the Queen's Hall in Regent Street that  accommodation could be found.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is now common knowledge the promoters  might have ventured upon the Albert Hall and still found their space  too scanty.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was for the second evening after our arrival that the great meeting  had been fixed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For the first, we had each, no doubt, our own pressing  personal affairs to absorb us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of mine I cannot yet speak.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It may be  that as it stands further from me I may think of it, and even speak of  it, with less emotion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have shown the reader in the beginning of  this narrative where lay the springs of my action.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It is but right,  perhaps, that I should carry on the tale and show also the results.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And yet the day may come when I would not have it otherwise.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At least  I have been driven forth to take part in a wondrous adventure, and I  cannot but be thankful to the force that drove me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And now I turn to the last supreme eventful moment of our adventure.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As I was racking my brain as to how I should best describe it, my eyes  fell upon the issue of my own Journal for the morning of the 8th of  November with the full and excellent account of my friend and  fellow-reporter Macdona.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What can I do better than transcribe his  narrative--head-lines and all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I admit that the paper was exuberant in  the matter, out of compliment to its own enterprise in sending a  correspondent, but the other great dailies were hardly less full in  their account.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Thus, then, friend Mac in his report:                                 THE NEW WORLD                   GREAT MEETING AT THE QUEEN'S HALL                            SCENES OF UPROAR                         EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENT                              WHAT WAS IT.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>NOCTURNAL RIOT IN REGENT STREET                               (Special)      "The much-discussed meeting of the Zoological Institute, convened to  hear the report of the Committee of Investigation sent out last year to  South America to test the assertions made by Professor Challenger as to  the continued existence of prehistoric life upon that Continent, was  held last night in the greater Queen's Hall, and it is safe to say that  it is likely to be a red letter date in the history of Science, for the  proceedings were of so remarkable and sensational a character that no  one present is ever likely to forget them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (Oh, brother scribe  Macdona, what a monstrous opening sentence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  "The tickets were  theoretically confined to members and their friends, but the latter is  an elastic term, and long before eight o'clock, the hour fixed for the  commencement of the proceedings, all parts of the Great Hall were  tightly packed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The general public, however, which most unreasonably  entertained a grievance at having been excluded, stormed the doors at a  quarter to eight, after a prolonged melee in which several people were  injured, including Inspector Scoble of H.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Division, whose leg was  unfortunately broken.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>After this unwarrantable invasion, which not  only filled every passage, but even intruded upon the space set apart  for the Press, it is estimated that nearly five thousand people awaited  the arrival of the travelers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>When they eventually appeared, they took  their places in the front of a platform which already contained all the  leading scientific men, not only of this country, but of France and of  Germany.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Sweden was also represented, in the person of Professor  Sergius, the famous Zoologist of the University of Upsala.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The  entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a  remarkable demonstration of welcome, the whole audience rising and  cheering for some minutes.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>An acute observer might, however, have  detected some signs of dissent amid the applause, and gathered that the  proceedings were likely to become more lively than harmonious.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It may  safely be prophesied, however, that no one could have foreseen the  extraordinary turn which they were actually to take.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Of the appearance of the four wanderers little need be said, since  their photographs have for some time been appearing in all the papers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They bear few traces of the hardships which they are said to have  undergone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger's beard may be more shaggy, Professor  Summerlee's features more ascetic, Lord John Roxton's figure more  gaunt, and all three may be burned to a darker tint than when they left  our shores, but each appeared to be in most excellent health.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to  our own representative, the well-known athlete and international Rugby  football player, E.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>D.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone, he looks trained to a hair, and as he  surveyed the crowd a smile of good-humored contentment pervaded his  honest but homely face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"  (All right, Mac, wait till I get you alone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)    "When quiet had been restored and the audience resumed their seats  after the ovation which they had given to the travelers, the chairman,  the Duke of Durham, addressed the meeting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'He would not,' he said,  'stand for more than a moment between that vast assembly and the treat  which lay before them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was not for him to anticipate what Professor  Summerlee, who was the spokesman of the committee, had to say to them,  but it was common rumor that their expedition had been crowned by  extraordinary success.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'  (Applause.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  'Apparently the age of romance  was not dead, and there was common ground upon which the wildest  imaginings of the novelist could meet the actual scientific  investigations of the searcher for truth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He would only add, before he  sat down, that he rejoiced--and all of them would rejoice--that these  gentlemen had returned safe and sound from their difficult and  dangerous task, for it cannot be denied that any disaster to such an  expedition would have inflicted a well-nigh irreparable loss to the  cause of Zoological science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>' (Great applause, in which Professor  Challenger was observed to join.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)    "Professor Summerlee's rising was the signal for another extraordinary  outbreak of enthusiasm, which broke out again at intervals throughout  his address.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That address will not be given in extenso in these  columns, for the reason that a full account of the whole adventures of  the expedition is being published as a supplement from the pen of our  own special correspondent.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some general indications will therefore  suffice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Having described the genesis of their journey, and paid a  handsome tribute to his friend Professor Challenger, coupled with an  apology for the incredulity with which his assertions, now fully  vindicated, had been received, he gave the actual course of their  journey, carefully withholding such information as would aid the public  in any attempt to locate this remarkable plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Having described, in  general terms, their course from the main river up to the time that  they actually reached the base of the cliffs, he enthralled his hearers  by his account of the difficulties encountered by the expedition in  their repeated attempts to mount them, and finally described how they  succeeded in their desperate endeavors, which cost the lives of their  two devoted half-breed servants.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" (This amazing reading of the affair  was the result of Summerlee's endeavors to avoid raising any  questionable matter at the meeting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)    "Having conducted his audience in fancy to the summit, and marooned  them there by reason of the fall of their bridge, the Professor  proceeded to describe both the horrors and the attractions of that  remarkable land.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of personal adventures he said little, but laid  stress upon the rich harvest reaped by Science in the observations of  the wonderful beast, bird, insect, and plant life of the plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Peculiarly rich in the coleoptera and in the lepidoptera, forty-six new  species of the one and ninety-four of the other had been secured in the  course of a few weeks.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was, however, in the larger animals, and  especially in the larger animals supposed to have been long extinct,  that the interest of the public was naturally centered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of these he  was able to give a goodly list, but had little doubt that it would be  largely extended when the place had been more thoroughly investigated.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He and his companions had seen at least a dozen creatures, most of them  at a distance, which corresponded with nothing at present known to  Science.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>These would in time be duly classified and examined.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He  instanced a snake, the cast skin of which, deep purple in color, was  fifty-one feet in length, and mentioned a white creature, supposed to  be mammalian, which gave forth well-marked phosphorescence in the  darkness; also a large black moth, the bite of which was supposed by  the Indians to be highly poisonous.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Setting aside these entirely new  forms of life, the plateau was very rich in known prehistoric forms,  dating back in some cases to early Jurassic times.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Among these he  mentioned the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus, seen once by Mr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Malone at a drinking-place by the lake, and drawn in the sketch-book of  that adventurous American who had first penetrated this unknown world.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He described also the iguanodon and the pterodactyl--two of the first  of the wonders which they had encountered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He then thrilled the  assembly by some account of the terrible carnivorous dinosaurs, which  had on more than one occasion pursued members of the party, and which  were the most formidable of all the creatures which they had  encountered.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Thence he passed to the huge and ferocious bird, the  phororachus, and to the great elk which still roams upon this upland.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was not, however, until he sketched the mysteries of the central  lake that the full interest and enthusiasm of the audience were  aroused.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One had to pinch oneself to be sure that one was awake as one  heard this sane and practical Professor in cold measured tones  describing the monstrous three-eyed fish-lizards and the huge  water-snakes which inhabit this enchanted sheet of water.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Next he  touched upon the Indians, and upon the extraordinary colony of  anthropoid apes, which might be looked upon as an advance upon the  pithecanthropus of Java, and as coming therefore nearer than any known  form to that hypothetical creation, the missing link.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally he  described, amongst some merriment, the ingenious but highly dangerous  aeronautic invention of Professor Challenger, and wound up a most  memorable address by an account of the methods by which the committee  did at last find their way back to civilization.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"It had been hoped that the proceedings would end there, and that a  vote of thanks and congratulation, moved by Professor Sergius, of  Upsala University, would be duly seconded and carried; but it was soon  evident that the course of events was not destined to flow so smoothly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Symptoms of opposition had been evident from time to time during the  evening, and now Dr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>James Illingworth, of Edinburgh, rose in the  center of the hall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Dr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Illingworth asked whether an amendment should  not be taken before a resolution.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"THE CHAIRMAN:  'Yes, sir, if there must be an amendment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'    "DR.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>ILLINGWORTH:  'Your Grace, there must be an amendment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'    "THE CHAIRMAN:  'Then let us take it at once.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'    "PROFESSOR SUMMERLEE (springing to his feet):  'Might I explain, your  Grace, that this man is my personal enemy ever since our controversy in  the Quarterly Journal of Science as to the true nature of Bathybius.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'    "THE CHAIRMAN:  'I fear I cannot go into personal matters.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Proceed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'    "Dr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Illingworth was imperfectly heard in part of his remarks on  account of the strenuous opposition of the friends of the explorers.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some attempts were also made to pull him down.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Being a man of enormous  physique, however, and possessed of a very powerful voice, he dominated  the tumult and succeeded in finishing his speech.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was clear, from  the moment of his rising, that he had a number of friends and  sympathizers in the hall, though they formed a minority in the  audience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The attitude of the greater part of the public might be  described as one of attentive neutrality.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Dr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Illingworth began his remarks by expressing his high appreciation  of the scientific work both of Professor Challenger and of Professor  Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He much regretted that any personal bias should have been  read into his remarks, which were entirely dictated by his desire for  scientific truth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His position, in fact, was substantially the same as  that taken up by Professor Summerlee at the last meeting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>At that last  meeting Professor Challenger had made certain assertions which had been  queried by his colleague.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now this colleague came forward himself with  the same assertions and expected them to remain unquestioned.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Was this  reasonable.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>('Yes,' 'No,' and prolonged interruption, during which  Professor Challenger was heard from the Press box to ask leave from the  chairman to put Dr.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Illingworth into the street.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>) A year ago one man  said certain things.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Now four men said other and more startling ones.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Was this to constitute a final proof where the matters in question were  of the most revolutionary and incredible character.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There had been  recent examples of travelers arriving from the unknown with certain  tales which had been too readily accepted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Was the London Zoological  Institute to place itself in this position.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He admitted that the  members of the committee were men of character.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But human nature was  very complex.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even Professors might be misled by the desire for  notoriety.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Like moths, we all love best to flutter in the light.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Heavy-game shots liked to be in a position to cap the tales of their  rivals, and journalists were not averse from sensational coups, even  when imagination had to aid fact in the process.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Each member of the  committee had his own motive for making the most of his results.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>('Shame.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>shame.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>)  The corroboration of these wondrous tales was really of  the most slender description.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What did it amount to.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Some  photographs.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>{Was it possible that in this age of ingenious  manipulation photographs could be accepted as evidence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>}  What more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We have a story of a flight and a descent by ropes which precluded the  production of larger specimens.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was ingenious, but not convincing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was understood that Lord John Roxton claimed to have the skull of a  phororachus.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>He could only say that he would like to see that skull.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"LORD JOHN ROXTON:  'Is this fellow calling me a liar.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'    "It is difficult to describe the confusion caused by this amendment.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A  large section of the audience expressed their indignation at such a  slur upon the travelers by noisy shouts of dissent and cries of, 'Don't  put it.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'  'Turn him out.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was only the moderating influence of the presence of  large numbers of ladies which prevented an absolute riot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Suddenly,  however, there was a pause, a hush, and then complete silence.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger was on his feet.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>His appearance and manner are  peculiarly arresting, and as he raised his hand for order the whole  audience settled down expectantly to give him a hearing.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"'It will be within the recollection of many present,' said Professor  Challenger, 'that similar foolish and unmannerly scenes marked the last  meeting at which I have been able to address them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>On that occasion  Professor Summerlee was the chief offender, and though he is now  chastened and contrite, the matter could not be entirely forgotten.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  have heard to-night similar, but even more offensive, sentiments from  the person who has just sat down, and though it is a conscious effort  of self-effacement to come down to that person's mental level, I will  endeavor to do so, in order to allay any reasonable doubt which could  possibly exist in the minds of anyone.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have safely conducted these three gentlemen to the spot  mentioned, and I have, as you have heard, convinced them of the  accuracy of my previous account.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We had hoped that we should find upon  our return that no one was so dense as to dispute our joint  conclusions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Warned, however, by my previous experience, I have not  come without such proofs as may convince a reasonable man.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As  explained by Professor Summerlee, our cameras have been tampered with  by the ape-men when they ransacked our camp, and most of our negatives  ruined.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>An instant later he re-appeared in company of a gigantic negro, the two  of them bearing between them a large square packing-case.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was  evidently of great weight, and was slowly carried forward and placed in  front of the Professor's chair.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>All sound had hushed in the audience  and everyone was absorbed in the spectacle before them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor  Challenger drew off the top of the case, which formed a sliding lid.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Peering down into the box he snapped his fingers several times and was  heard from the Press seat to say, 'Come, then, pretty, pretty.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>An instant later, with a scratching, rattling sound, a  most horrible and loathsome creature appeared from below and perched  itself upon the side of the case.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Even the unexpected fall of the Duke  of Durham into the orchestra, which occurred at this moment, could not  distract the petrified attention of the vast audience.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The face of the  creature was like the wildest gargoyle that the imagination of a mad  medieval builder could have conceived.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was malicious, horrible,  with two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Its long,  savage mouth, which was held half-open, was full of a double row of  shark-like teeth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Its shoulders were humped, and round them were  draped what appeared to be a faded gray shawl.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the devil of our  childhood in person.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a turmoil in the audience--someone  screamed, two ladies in the front row fell senseless from their chairs,  and there was a general movement upon the platform to follow their  chairman into the orchestra.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For a moment there was danger of a  general panic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger threw up his hands to still the  commotion, but the movement alarmed the creature beside him.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Its  strange shawl suddenly unfurled, spread, and fluttered as a pair of  leathery wings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Its owner grabbed at its legs, but too late to hold  it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the  Queen's Hall with a dry, leathery flapping of its ten-foot wings, while  a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The cries of the people  in the galleries, who were alarmed at the near approach of those  glowing eyes and that murderous beak, excited the creature to a frenzy.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Faster and faster it flew, beating against walls and chandeliers in a  blind frenzy of alarm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'The window.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a moment the creature, beating and bumping along the wall like a  huge moth within a gas-shade, came upon the opening, squeezed its  hideous bulk through it, and was gone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Professor Challenger fell back  into his chair with his face buried in his hands, while the audience  gave one long, deep sigh of relief as they realized that the incident  was over.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>up with them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>' cried a hundred voices.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a moment four figures shot up above the crowd.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In vain they strove  to break loose.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>They were held in their lofty places of honor.

Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Regent Street.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>' sounded  the voices.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was a swirl in the packed multitude, and a slow  current, bearing the four upon their shoulders, made for the door.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Out  in the street the scene was extraordinary.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>An assemblage of not less  than a hundred thousand people was waiting.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The close-packed throng  extended from the other side of the Langham Hotel to Oxford Circus.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A  roar of acclamation greeted the four adventurers as they appeared, high  above the heads of the people, under the vivid electric lamps outside  the hall.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>'A procession.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>A procession.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>' was the cry.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In a dense  phalanx, blocking the streets from side to side, the crowd set forth,  taking the route of Regent Street, Pall Mall, St.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>James's Street, and  Piccadilly.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The whole central traffic of London was held up, and many  collisions were reported between the demonstrators upon the one side  and the police and taxi-cabmen upon the other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally, it was not  until after midnight that the four travelers were released at the  entrance to Lord John Roxton's chambers in the Albany, and that the  exuberant crowd, having sung 'They are Jolly Good Fellows' in chorus,  concluded their program with 'God Save the King.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>' So ended one of the  most remarkable evenings that London has seen for a considerable time.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    So far my friend Macdona; and it may be taken as a fairly accurate, if  florid, account of the proceedings.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to the main incident, it was a  bewildering surprise to the audience, but not, I need hardly say, to  us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The reader will remember how I met Lord John Roxton upon the very  occasion when, in his protective crinoline, he had gone to bring the  "Devil's chick" as he called it, for Professor Challenger.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I have  hinted also at the trouble which the Professor's baggage gave us when  we left the plateau, and had I described our voyage I might have said a  good deal of the worry we had to coax with putrid fish the appetite of  our filthy companion.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If I have not said much about it before, it was,  of course, that the Professor's earnest desire was that no possible  rumor of the unanswerable argument which we carried should be allowed  to leak out until the moment came when his enemies were to be confuted.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One word as to the fate of the London pterodactyl.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Nothing can be said  to be certain upon this point.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There is the evidence of two frightened  women that it perched upon the roof of the Queen's Hall and remained  there like a diabolical statue for some hours.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The next day it came  out in the evening papers that Private Miles, of the Coldstream Guards,  on duty outside Marlborough House, had deserted his post without leave,  and was therefore courtmartialed.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Private Miles' account, that he  dropped his rifle and took to his heels down the Mall because on  looking up he had suddenly seen the devil between him and the moon, was  not accepted by the Court, and yet it may have a direct bearing upon  the point at issue.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The only other evidence which I can adduce is from  the log of the SS.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Friesland, a Dutch-American liner, which asserts  that at nine next morning, Start Point being at the time ten miles upon  their starboard quarter, they were passed by something between a flying  goat and a monstrous bat, which was heading at a prodigious pace south  and west.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>If its homing instinct led it upon the right line, there can  be no doubt that somewhere out in the wastes of the Atlantic the last  European pterodactyl found its end.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And Gladys--oh, my Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>--Gladys of the mystic lake, now to be  re-named the Central, for never shall she have immortality through me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Did I not always see some hard fiber in her nature.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Did I not, even at  the time when I was proud to obey her behest, feel that it was surely a  poor love which could drive a lover to his death or the danger of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Did I not, in my truest thoughts, always recurring and always  dismissed, see past the beauty of the face, and, peering into the soul,  discern the twin shadows of selfishness and of fickleness glooming at  the back of it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Did she love the heroic and the spectacular for its  own noble sake, or was it for the glory which might, without effort or  sacrifice, be reflected upon herself.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Or are these thoughts the vain  wisdom which comes after the event.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was the shock of my life.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>For  a moment it had turned me to a cynic.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But already, as I write, a week  has passed, and we have had our momentous interview with Lord John  Roxton and--well, perhaps things might be worse.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let me tell it in a few words.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No letter or telegram had come to me at  Southampton, and I reached the little villa at Streatham about ten  o'clock that night in a fever of alarm.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Was she dead or alive.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Where  were all my nightly dreams of the open arms, the smiling face, the  words of praise for her man who had risked his life to humor her whim.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Already I was down from the high peaks and standing flat-footed upon  earth.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Yet some good reasons given might still lift me to the clouds  once more.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I rushed down the garden path, hammered at the door, heard  the voice of Gladys within, pushed past the staring maid, and strode  into the sitting-room.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>She was seated in a low settee under the shaded  standard lamp by the piano.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>In three steps I was across the room and  had both her hands in mine.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried, "Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    She looked up with amazement in her face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>She was altered in some  subtle way.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>The expression of her eyes, the hard upward stare, the set  of the lips, was new to me.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>She drew back her hands.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What do you mean.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" she said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What is the matter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You are my Gladys, are you  not--little Gladys Hungerton.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No," said she, "I am Gladys Potts.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Let me introduce you to my  husband.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    How absurd life is.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I found myself mechanically bowing and shaking  hands with a little ginger-haired man who was coiled up in the deep  arm-chair which had once been sacred to my own use.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We bobbed and  grinned in front of each other.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Father lets us stay here.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>We are getting our house ready," said  Gladys.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Oh, yes," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"You didn't get my letter at Para, then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No, I got no letter.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Oh, what a pity.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It would have made all clear.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "It is quite clear," said I.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I've told William all about you," said she.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"We have no secrets.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  am so sorry about it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But it couldn't have been so very deep, could  it, if you could go off to the other end of the world and leave me here  alone.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You're not crabby, are you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "No, no, not at all.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I think I'll go.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Have some refreshment," said the little man, and he added, in a  confidential way, "It's always like this, ain't it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And must be unless  you had polygamy, only the other way round; you understand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" He laughed  like an idiot, while I made for the door.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I was through it, when a sudden fantastic impulse came upon me, and I  went back to my successful rival, who looked nervously at the electric  push.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Will you answer a question.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" I asked.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, within reason," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"How did you do it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Have you searched for hidden treasure, or  discovered a pole, or done time on a pirate, or flown the Channel, or  what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Where is the glamour of romance.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>How did you get it.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He stared at me with a hopeless expression upon his vacuous,  good-natured, scrubby little face.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Don't you think all this is a little too personal.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" he said.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, just one question," I cried.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"What are you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>What is your  profession.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I am a solicitor's clerk," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Second man at Johnson and  Merivale's, 41 Chancery Lane.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Good-night.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" said I, and vanished, like all disconsolate and  broken-hearted heroes, into the darkness, with grief and rage and  laughter all simmering within me like a boiling pot.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>One more little scene, and I have done.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Last night we all supped at  Lord John Roxton's rooms, and sitting together afterwards we smoked in  good comradeship and talked our adventures over.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was strange under  these altered surroundings to see the old, well-known faces and  figures.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>There was Challenger, with his smile of condescension, his  drooping eyelids, his intolerant eyes, his aggressive beard, his huge  chest, swelling and puffing as he laid down the law to Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>And  Summerlee, too, there he was with his short briar between his thin  moustache and his gray goat's-beard, his worn face protruded in eager  debate as he queried all Challenger's propositions.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Finally, there was  our host, with his rugged, eagle face, and his cold, blue, glacier eyes  with always a shimmer of devilment and of humor down in the depths of  them.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Such is the last picture of them that I have carried away.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It was after supper, in his own sanctum--the room of the pink radiance  and the innumerable trophies--that Lord John Roxton had something to  say to us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>From a cupboard he had brought an old cigar-box, and this  he laid before him on the table.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"There's one thing," said he, "that maybe I should have spoken about  before this, but I wanted to know a little more clearly where I was.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>No use to raise hopes and let them down again.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>But it's facts, not  hopes, with us now.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>You may remember that day we found the pterodactyl  rookery in the swamp--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, somethin' in the lie of the land  took my notice.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Perhaps it has escaped you, so I will tell you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>It  was a volcanic vent full of blue clay.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>" The Professors nodded.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, now, in the whole world I've only had to do with one place that  was a volcanic vent of blue clay.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>That was the great De Beers Diamond  Mine of Kimberley--what.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>So you see I got diamonds into my head.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  rigged up a contraption to hold off those stinking beasts, and I spent  a happy day there with a spud.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>This is what I got.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He opened his cigar-box, and tilting it over he poured about twenty or  thirty rough stones, varying from the size of beans to that of  chestnuts, on the table.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Perhaps you think I should have told you then.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, so I should,  only I know there are a lot of traps for the unwary, and that stones  may be of any size and yet of little value where color and consistency  are clean off.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Therefore, I brought them back, and on the first day at  home I took one round to Spink's, and asked him to have it roughly cut  and valued.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    He took a pill-box from his pocket, and spilled out of it a beautiful  glittering diamond, one of the finest stones that I have ever seen.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"There's the result," said he.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"He prices the lot at a minimum of two  hundred thousand pounds.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Of course it is fair shares between us.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>I  won't hear of anythin' else.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>Well, Challenger, what will you do with  your fifty thousand.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "If you really persist in your generous view," said the Professor, "I  should found a private museum, which has long been one of my dreams.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "And you, Summerlee.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I would retire from teaching, and so find time for my final  classification of the chalk fossils.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "I'll use my own," said Lord John Roxton, "in fitting a well-formed  expedition and having another look at the dear old plateau.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>As to you,  young fellah, you, of course, will spend yours in gettin' married.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    "Not just yet," said I, with a rueful smile.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"I think, if you will  have me, that I would rather go with you.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"    Lord Roxton said nothing, but a brown hand was stretched out to me  across the table.
Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>.
